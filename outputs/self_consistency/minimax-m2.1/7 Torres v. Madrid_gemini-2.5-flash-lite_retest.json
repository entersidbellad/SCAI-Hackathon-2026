Your job is to find ANY and ALL errors in AI-generated Supreme Court case summaries.\n\nCompare the GENERATED SUMMARY against the REFERENCE SUMMARY (ground truth).\n\n## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):\nFacts of the case\n\nIn 2014, Roxanne Torres was involved in an incident with police officers in which she was operating a vehicle under the influence of methamphetamine and in the process of trying to get away, endangered the two officers pursuing her. In the process, one of the officers shot and injured her. Torres pleaded no contest to three crimes: (1) aggravated fleeing from a law enforcement officer, (2) assault on a police officer, and (3) unlawfully taking a motor vehicle.\n\nIn October 2016, she filed a civil-rights complaint in federal court against the two officers, alleging claims including excessive force and conspiracy to engage in excessive force. Construing Torres's complaint as asserting the excessive-force claims under the Fourth Amendment, the court concluded that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity. In the court's view, the officers had not seized Torres at the time of the shooting, and without a seizure, there could be no Fourth Amendment violation. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed.\n\nQuestion\nMust physical force used to detain a suspect be successful to constitute a \"seizure\" under the Fourth Amendment?\n\nConclusion\nThe application of physical force to the body of a person with intent to restrain is a seizure, even if the force does not succeed in subduing the person. Chief Justice John Roberts authored the majority opinion.\n\nUnder the Court's precedents, common law arrests are considered seizures under the Fourth Amendment, and the application of force to the body of a person with intent to restrain constitutes an arrest even if the arrestee escapes. The use of a device, here, a gun, to effect the arrest, makes no difference in the outcome; it is still a seizure. There is no reason to draw an \"artificial line\" between grasping an arrestee with a hand and using some other means of applying physical force to effect an arrest. The key consideration is whether the conduct objectively manifests the intent to restrain; subjective perceptions are irrelevant. Additionally, the requirement of intent to restrain lasts only as long as the application of force. In this case, the officers' conduct clearly manifested intent to restrain Torres and was thus a seizure under the Fourth Amendment.\n\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch authored a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito joined, arguing that \"neither the Constitution nor common sense\" support the majority's definition of a seizure.\n\n\n## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):\nHere is a summary of the Supreme Court opinion in *Torres v. Madrid et al.*:\n\n### 1. Facts of the Case\n\nOn July 15, 2014, New Mexico State Police officers Janice Madrid and Richard Williamson arrived at an Albuquerque apartment complex to execute an arrest warrant. They approached Roxanne Torres, who was standing near a Toyota FJ Cruiser. As Torres entered the driver's seat, the officers attempted to speak with her. Believing the officers to be carjackers, Torres accelerated her vehicle to escape. The officers then fired their service pistols 13 times, striking Torres twice. Despite being shot, Torres managed to drive away, eventually reaching a hospital 75 miles away. She was later airlifted to another hospital in Albuquerque, where she was arrested the following day. Torres subsequently filed a lawsuit against Officers Madrid and Williamson under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that they used excessive force and that the shooting constituted an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's grant of summary judgment to the officers, holding that a suspect's continued flight after being shot negates a Fourth Amendment excessive force claim.\n\n### 2. Legal Question(s)\n\nThe primary legal question before the Supreme Court was: Does the application of physical force to a person's body with the intent to restrain constitute a seizure under the Fourth Amendment, even if the person does not submit to the force and is not subdued?\n\n### 3. Conclusion/Holding\n\nThe Supreme Court held that the application of physical force to the body of a person with the intent to restrain is a seizure under the Fourth Amendment, even if the person does not submit and is not subdued.\n\nThe Court reasoned that its precedents have interpreted the term \"seizure\" by consulting the common law of arrest. In *California v. Hodari D.*, 499 U. S. 621 (1991), the Court explained that the common law considered the application of physical force to the body with the intent to restrain to be an arrest, regardless of whether the person yielded. The Court reviewed historical English and American legal decisions, confirming that the slightest touching with the intent to restrain was sufficient to complete an arrest. The Court found no basis to distinguish between a \"laying on of hands\" and other means of applying physical force, such as a bullet, to effect an arrest. The Court emphasized that the Fourth Amendment's focus is on the privacy and security of individuals, not the specific method of governmental intrusion.\n\nThe Court clarified that a seizure by force requires the use of force with the intent to restrain, not force applied accidentally or for another purpose. The objective manifestation of intent to restrain is the relevant inquiry, not the subjective motivation of the officer or the perception of the suspect. Furthermore, a seizure by force lasts only as long as the application of force, unless the suspect submits.\n\nApplying this principle, the Court concluded that the officers seized Torres at the instant the bullets struck her, as the application of physical force objectively manifested an intent to restrain her movement. The Court vacated the Tenth Circuit's judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings, leaving open questions regarding the reasonableness of the seizure, the damages caused, and the officers' entitlement to qualified immunity.\n\n## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:\n   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?\n   - **Severity Assessment**:\n     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**\n     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**\n     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**\n\n2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:\n   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**\n   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**\n\n3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:\n   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**\n   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**\n\n## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):\nScore based on the *worst* error found.
