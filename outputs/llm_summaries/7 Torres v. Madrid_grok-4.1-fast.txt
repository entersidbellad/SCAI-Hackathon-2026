### 1. Facts of the Case
Petitioner Roxanne Torres sued respondents Janice Madrid and Richard Williamson, officers with the New Mexico State Police, under 42 U.S.C. §1983, alleging that they used excessive force, constituting an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment. On July 15, 2014, the officers arrived at an Albuquerque apartment complex to execute an arrest warrant for a woman accused of white-collar crimes and suspected of involvement in drug trafficking, murder, and other violent crimes. The officers observed Torres, who was experiencing methamphetamine withdrawal, standing near a Toyota FJ Cruiser. As the officers approached, Torres entered the driver's seat. Believing the officers—who wore tactical vests marked with police identification but whom she perceived only as armed carjackers—posed a threat, Torres accelerated to escape. Neither officer stood in the vehicle's path, but both fired their service pistols 13 times, striking Torres twice in the back and temporarily paralyzing her left arm. Steering with her right arm, Torres exited the complex, drove a short distance, stopped in a parking lot, asked a bystander to report an attempted carjacking, stole a nearby idling Kia Soul, and drove 75 miles to a hospital in Grants, New Mexico. She was airlifted to a hospital in Albuquerque, where police arrested her the next day. Torres pleaded no contest to aggravated fleeing from a law enforcement officer, assault on a peace officer, and unlawfully taking a motor vehicle. The District Court granted summary judgment to the officers. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed, holding that "a suspect’s continued flight after being shot by police negates a Fourth Amendment excessive-force claim," relying on its precedent that "no seizure can occur unless there is physical touch or a show of authority," and that "such physical touch (or force) must terminate the suspect’s movement" or give rise to physical control (Brooks v. Gaenzle, 614 F.3d 1213, 1223 (CA10 2010); Torres v. Madrid, 769 Fed. Appx. 654, 657 (CA10 2019)). The Supreme Court granted certiorari (589 U.S. ___ (2019)).

### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Court addressed whether the application of physical force to the body of a person with intent to restrain constitutes a Fourth Amendment seizure even if the person does not submit and is not subdued, specifically whether an officer seizes a person by shooting her if she temporarily eludes capture after the shooting. The Court examined the meaning of "seizure" under the Fourth Amendment by reference to the common law of arrest, distinguishing seizures effected by physical force from those by show of authority, and rejected an alternative test of intentional acquisition of physical control.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Court held that the application of physical force to the body of a person with intent to restrain is a Fourth Amendment seizure even if the person does not submit and is not subdued (Pp. 3–18). Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court, joined by Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan, and Kavanaugh. The Court reasoned that its precedents interpret "seizure" by consulting the common law of arrest, the "quintessential" seizure of the person (Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 585; California v. Hodari D., 499 U.S. 621, 624 (1991)). At common law, the application of physical force with intent to restrain constituted an arrest—even if the person did not yield—based on the "slightest touching" as constructive detention (e.g., Genner v. Sparks, 6 Mod. 173, 87 Eng. Rep. 928 (QB 1704); 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 288 (1768); cases like Anonymus, 1 Vent. 306, 86 Eng. Rep. 197 (KB 1677); Nicholl v. Darley, 2 Y. & J. 399, 400, 148 Eng. Rep. 974 (Exch. 1828)). This rule applied equally to criminal and civil arrests and extended to force from a distance, such as a bullet, as the Fourth Amendment focuses on individual privacy and security, not the form of intrusion (Camara v. Municipal Court of City and County of San Francisco, 387 U.S. 523, 528 (1967)). A seizure requires force applied with objective intent to restrain, not by accident or other purpose (County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 844 (1998); Michigan v. Chesternut, 486 U.S. 567, 574 (1988)), independent of officer or suspect subjective motivations or perceptions. A seizure by force lasts only as long as the force is applied, absent submission (Hodari D., 499 U.S., at 625). The Court rejected the officers' proposed uniform test of "intentional acquisition of physical control" (Brower v. County of Inyo, 489 U.S. 593, 596 (1989)), as it lacks historical or precedential support, conflates seizures by force (requiring mere-touch rule) with those by control or show of authority (requiring submission or termination of movement), and creates line-drawing uncertainties avoided by the common law rule. Applying the rule, the officers seized Torres for the instant the bullets struck her, manifesting objective intent to restrain her movement. The Court did not address the reasonableness of the seizure, damages, or qualified immunity. The judgment of the Tenth Circuit (769 Fed. Appx. 654) was vacated and remanded. Justice Gorsuch filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Thomas and Alito. Justice Barrett took no part.
