### Summary of the Supreme Court Opinion in Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue

#### 1. Facts of the Case
The Montana Legislature established a scholarship program in 2015 to provide tuition assistance to parents sending their children to private schools. The program granted tax credits to donors who contributed to student scholarship organizations, which in turn awarded scholarships to selected students. The Montana Department of Revenue promulgated "Rule 1," which prohibited families from using the scholarships at religious schools, citing the Montana Constitution's no-aid provision (Article X, §6(1)). Three mothers, whose children attended a Christian private school, sued the Department, alleging that Rule 1 discriminated against their religious views and the school they chose. The trial court enjoined Rule 1, but the Montana Supreme Court reversed, holding that the program, without Rule 1, aided religious schools in violation of the no-aid provision and invalidated the entire program.

#### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Court addressed whether the application of Montana's no-aid provision, as interpreted by the Montana Supreme Court, discriminated against religious schools and the families whose children attend or hope to attend them, in violation of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.

#### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Supreme Court held that the application of Montana's no-aid provision discriminated against religious schools and the families whose children attend or hope to attend them, in violation of the Free Exercise Clause. The Court applied strict scrutiny because the no-aid provision excluded religious schools from public benefits solely because of their religious status. The Court found that the provision imposed a penalty on the free exercise of religion and that the State's interest in greater separation of church and State than required by the Federal Constitution was not compelling. The Court also rejected the argument that Locke v. Davey governed this case, as Locke involved a denial of a scholarship due to the specific religious use of the funds (training for the ministry), whereas Montana's no-aid provision barred aid to religious schools simply because of their religious status. The Court reversed the Montana Supreme Court's judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings, holding that the Free Exercise Clause barred the application of the no-aid provision and that the Montana Supreme Court had no authority to invalidate the program on that basis.
