### 1. Facts of the Case

The case involves a challenge to the appointment process of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico (the Board), created by Congress under the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) in 2016. The Board was established to oversee Puerto Rico's finances and restructure its debts due to a severe fiscal crisis. The seven voting members of the Board were appointed by President Obama without Senate confirmation. Creditors challenged the appointments, arguing they violated the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which requires Senate confirmation for "Officers of the United States." The District Court denied the creditors' motions to dismiss, but the First Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Board members' appointments violated the Appointments Clause. The First Circuit also applied the "de facto officer" doctrine to validate actions taken by the Board prior to its decision.

### 2. Legal Question(s)

The primary legal question addressed by the Supreme Court is whether the appointment of the Financial Oversight and Management Board members without Senate confirmation violates the Appointments Clause (Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution). Specifically, the Court must determine if the Board members are "Officers of the United States" subject to the Appointments Clause.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding

The Supreme Court held that while the Appointments Clause applies to all "Officers of the United States," including those with powers and duties related to Puerto Rico, the Board members are not "Officers of the United States" because they have primarily local powers and duties. The Court reasoned that the Constitution grants Congress the power to create local offices for the District of Columbia and Territories under Article I, Section 8, Clause 17, and Article IV, Section 3, Clause 2. Historically, Congress has used these powers to create local offices with primarily local duties, and officials in such positions are not considered "Officers of the United States." The Board's responsibilities, such as representing Puerto Rico in bankruptcy proceedings and overseeing Puerto Rico's fiscal and budgetary policies, are primarily local in nature. Therefore, the Appointments Clause does not dictate how the Board's members must be selected, and their appointment without Senate confirmation is constitutional. The Court reversed the First Circuit's judgment and remanded the cases for further proceedings.
