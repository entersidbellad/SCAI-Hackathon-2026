### Summary of Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro

#### 1. Facts of the Case
The case involves Encino Motorcars, LLC, a Mercedes-Benz dealership in California, and its current and former service advisors, who sued the company for backpay, alleging a violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) due to the failure to pay overtime. The service advisors' primary duties include meeting customers, listening to their concerns, suggesting repair and maintenance services, selling new accessories or replacement parts, recording service orders, following up with customers, and explaining the repair work. The District Court initially dismissed the suit, ruling that service advisors are exempt from the FLSA's overtime-pay requirement under 29 U.S.C. §213(b)(10)(A). The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this decision, deferring to a 2011 Department of Labor rule that interpreted "salesman" to exclude service advisors. The Supreme Court vacated the Ninth Circuit's judgment in Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro (Encino I), holding that the 2011 rule was procedurally defective and thus not entitled to deference. On remand, the Ninth Circuit again ruled that service advisors are not exempt.

#### 2. Legal Question(s)
The specific legal question addressed by the Court was whether service advisors at car dealerships are exempt from the FLSA's overtime-pay requirement under 29 U.S.C. §213(b)(10)(A), which exempts "any salesman, partsman, or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or servicing automobiles, trucks, or farm implements."

#### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Supreme Court held that service advisors are indeed exempt from the FLSA's overtime-pay requirement because they are "salesmen primarily engaged in servicing automobiles." The Court reasoned that the term "salesman" includes service advisors as they sell services to customers. Furthermore, service advisors are "primarily engaged in servicing automobiles" as they are integral to the servicing process, even though they do not physically repair automobiles. The Court rejected the Ninth Circuit's application of the distributive canon, which would have limited the exemption to salesmen engaged in selling automobiles. Instead, the Court applied a disjunctive reading of "or" in the statute, concluding that a salesman can be exempt if primarily engaged in either selling or servicing automobiles. The Court also rejected the principle that FLSA exemptions should be construed narrowly, stating that exemptions should be given a fair reading. The decision reversed the Ninth Circuit's judgment and remanded the case.
