### Summary of Muldrow v. City of St. Louis, Missouri, et al.

#### 1. Facts of the Case
Sergeant Jatonya Clayborn Muldrow, a female police officer with the St. Louis Police Department, was transferred from her position as a plainclothes officer in the Intelligence Division to a uniformed job in the Fifth District. The transfer was initiated by the new Intelligence Division commander, Captain Michael Deeba, who wanted to replace Muldrow with a male officer. Although Muldrow's rank and pay remained the same, her responsibilities, perks, and schedule changed significantly. She lost her FBI Task Force Officer status, her unmarked take-home vehicle, and her regular Monday-to-Friday schedule, and was instead given a rotating schedule that often involved weekend shifts. Muldrow brought a Title VII suit against the City of St. Louis, alleging that the transfer was discriminatory and affected the "terms [or] conditions" of her employment.

#### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Supreme Court addressed the specific legal question of whether an employee challenging a job transfer under Title VII must show that the transfer caused a "significant" or "materially significant disadvantage." The Court examined the statutory language of Title VII, specifically 42 U.S.C. §2000e–2(a)(1), which prohibits employers from discriminating against employees "with respect to" the "terms [or] conditions" of employment because of their sex or other protected trait.

#### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Supreme Court held that an employee challenging a job transfer under Title VII must show that the transfer brought about some harm with respect to an identifiable term or condition of employment, but that harm need not be significant. The Court rejected the "significance" standard applied by the lower courts, finding that it added a requirement not present in the statutory text. The Court vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with its holding. The Court's decision establishes that a plaintiff must show some injury respecting their employment terms or conditions, but does not need to meet a heightened threshold of harm. Muldrow's allegations, if properly preserved and supported, meet this test, as she was allegedly transferred because of her sex and suffered changes to her job responsibilities, schedule, and perks.
