### 1. Facts of the Case
Texas, along with 17 other states (Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi via its Governor, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia; Wisconsin was dismissed), and two individuals (Neill Hurley and John Nantz), sued the United States, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the IRS, and the Department of Health and Human Services. The suit challenged the minimum essential coverage provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, codified at 26 U.S.C. §5000A(a), claiming it is unconstitutional without the penalty (set to $0 by §11081 of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, Pub. L. 115–97, 131 Stat. 2092), and that the rest of the Act is not severable from §5000A(a). Plaintiffs sought a declaration of unconstitutionality, a finding of nonseverability, and an injunction against enforcement of the Act. California and 15 other states plus the District of Columbia (Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky via its Governor, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington; Colorado, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada joined on appeal) intervened to defend the Act, as did the U.S. House of Representatives on appeal. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Texas v. United States, 340 F. Supp. 3d 579 (2018)) found standing for individual plaintiffs, held §5000A(a) unconstitutional and nonseverable, declared the Act invalid, and stayed judgment (352 F. Supp. 3d 665 (2018)). The Fifth Circuit affirmed standing and unconstitutionality of §5000A(a) but found severability analysis incomplete and remanded (945 F. 3d 355 (2019)). California et al. petitioned for certiorari; Texas et al. conditionally cross-petitioned. The Supreme Court granted certiorari (Nos. 19–840 and 19–1019).

### 2. Legal Question(s)
Whether the plaintiffs have Article III standing to challenge the minimum essential coverage provision at 26 U.S.C. §5000A(a), requiring a showing of personal injury fairly traceable to the defendants' allegedly unlawful conduct in enforcing that provision and likely to be redressed by the requested relief (citing DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U. S. 332, 342 (2006); Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560–561 (1992)). Specific issues included: (1) for individual plaintiffs, whether pocketbook injuries from purchasing insurance are traceable to enforcement of §5000A(a) and redressable by declaratory relief; (2) for state plaintiffs, whether increased costs for state insurance programs (e.g., Medicaid, CHIP, state employee plans under 42 U.S.C. §§1396–1396w, §1397aa) or administrative/reporting expenses (e.g., under §§6055, 6056) are traceable to enforcement of §5000A(a).

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Supreme Court reversed the Fifth Circuit's judgment on standing, vacated it, and remanded with instructions to dismiss, holding that neither individual nor state plaintiffs have Article III standing because they failed to show concrete, particularized injury fairly traceable to the defendants' enforcement of §5000A(a). Justice Breyer delivered the opinion, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Thomas, Sotomayor, Kagan, Kavanaugh, and Barrett. Reasoning: §5000A(a) is unenforceable absent a penalty (now $0 under 26 U.S.C. §5000A(c), (g)), so no government enforcement causes injury (citing Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 751 (1984); Babbitt v. Farm Workers, 442 U. S. 289, 298 (1979)). For individuals, insurance purchase costs are not traceable to enforcement, and declaratory relief alone fails redressability (citing MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U. S. 118, 126–127 (2007)). For states, increased program enrollment is speculative and relies on unpredictable third-party actions without evidence post-2017 (citing Department of Commerce v. New York, 588 U. S. ___ (2019); Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U. S. 398, 410–411 (2013)); administrative costs (e.g., §§6055, 6056) and other obligations (e.g., employer mandate §4980H; dependent coverage §300gg–14; Medicaid expansion) arise from independent, unchallenged provisions. The Court declined novel standing theories not raised below or at certiorari. Justice Thomas concurred, emphasizing plaintiffs' failure to identify unlawful action causing injury. Justice Alito dissented (joined by Justice Gorsuch), arguing states have standing via traceability to enforceable ACA burdens allegedly inseverable from §5000A(a). Precedent reinforces that standing requires injury from actual/threatened enforcement of the challenged provision, not mere unenforceable text, and declaratory relief must satisfy case-or-controversy requirements to avoid advisory opinions (citing Carney v. Adams, 592 U. S. ___ (2020)). The Court did not reach §5000A(a)'s constitutionality or severability.
