### 1. Facts of the Case
The consolidated cases—Brown et al. v. Board of Education of Topeka et al. (No. 1, appeal from the United States District Court for the District of Kansas), Briggs et al. v. Elliott et al. (No. 2, appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of South Carolina), Davis et al. v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, Virginia, et al. (No. 4, appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia), and Gebhart et al. v. Belton et al. (No. 10, certiorari to the Supreme Court of Delaware)—involved minor children of the Negro race, through their legal representatives, denied admission to public schools attended by white children under state laws requiring or permitting racial segregation. In the Kansas case, Negro elementary school children in Topeka sought to enjoin a state statute permitting segregation in cities over 15,000 population (Kan. Gen. Stat. § 72-1724 (1949)); the three-judge district court found substantial equality in buildings, transportation, curricula, and teacher qualifications but denied relief (98 F. Supp. 797). In the South Carolina case, Negro elementary and high school children in Clarendon County sought to enjoin state constitutional and statutory segregation requirements (S.C. Const., Art. XI, § 7; S.C. Code § 5377 (1942)); the three-judge district court ordered equalization of facilities but upheld segregation and denied admission to white schools (98 F. Supp. 529, later 103 F. Supp. 920 after remand per 342 U.S. 350). In the Virginia case, Negro high school children in Prince Edward County sought to enjoin similar state provisions (Va. Const., § 140; Va. Code § 22-221 (1950)); the three-judge district court ordered equalization but upheld segregation (103 F. Supp. 337). In the Delaware case, Negro elementary and high school children in New Castle County sought to enjoin state provisions (Del. Const., Art. X, § 2; Del. Rev. Code § 2631 (1935)); the Chancellor and Delaware Supreme Court ordered admission to white schools due to Negro schools' inferiority in teacher training, pupil-teacher ratio, extracurricular activities, physical plant, and transportation (87 A. 2d 862; 91 A. 2d 137). In each case except Delaware, lower federal courts denied relief based on the "separate but equal" doctrine from Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537. The cases reached the Supreme Court on direct appeals under 28 U.S.C. § 1253 (Nos. 1, 2, 4) and certiorari (No. 10, 344 U.S. 891), with arguments in 1952 and rearguments in 1953.

### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Court addressed whether segregation of white and Negro children in public schools solely on the basis of race, pursuant to state laws permitting or requiring such segregation, denies Negro children the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, even though physical facilities and other "tangible" factors of white and Negro schools may be equal. This directly presented whether the "separate but equal" doctrine from Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, applies to public education, particularly where lower courts found or were equalizing tangible factors such as buildings, curricula, transportation, and teacher qualifications.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Court unanimously held that such segregation denies Negro children equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment, as separate educational facilities are inherently unequal. Chief Justice Warren's opinion reasoned that the history of the Fourteenth Amendment is inconclusive regarding public education, given its limited development in 1868 (e.g., nonexistent Negro education in the South, rudimentary Northern systems), requiring consideration of education's modern central role in American life as a right available on equal terms where states provide it, essential for citizenship, cultural awakening, professional training, and life success. Segregation itself deprives minority children of equal educational opportunities by generating a feeling of inferiority affecting their hearts and minds, supported by district court findings (e.g., Kansas: 98 F. Supp. 797; Delaware: 87 A. 2d 862, 865) and modern social science (e.g., K.B. Clark; Witmer and Kotinsky; Deutscher and Chein). Intangible qualities from graduate school cases (Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629; McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, 339 U.S. 637) apply more forcefully to children. Plessy v. Ferguson has no place in public education; contrary language is rejected. The disposition rendered unnecessary discussion of Due Process. Due to class action status, wide applicability, and local variations, the cases were restored to the docket for further argument on decree formulation (per reargument questions 4 and 5, 345 U.S. 972), inviting participation by the U.S. Attorney General and state Attorneys General. The precedent is that racial segregation in public schools violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
