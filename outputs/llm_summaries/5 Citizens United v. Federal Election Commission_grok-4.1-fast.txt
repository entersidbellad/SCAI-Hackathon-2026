### 1. Facts of the Case
Citizens United, a nonprofit corporation with an annual budget of about $12 million funded mostly by individual donations and a small portion from for-profit corporations, produced a 90-minute documentary film entitled *Hillary: The Movie* (referred to as *Hillary*), which was critical of then-Senator Hillary Clinton, a candidate for her party's 2008 presidential nomination. Citizens United sought to make *Hillary* available on cable television through video-on-demand within 30 days of primary elections and produced television ads (two 10-second and one 30-second) to promote it on broadcast and cable television. Anticipating civil and criminal penalties under 2 U.S.C. § 441b (as amended by § 203 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA)), which prohibits corporations and unions from using general treasury funds for "electioneering communications" or speech expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate, Citizens United filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. It argued that § 441b was unconstitutional as applied to *Hillary* and the ads, and that BCRA §§ 201 and 311 (disclosure and disclaimer requirements) were unconstitutional as applied to *Hillary* and the ads. A three-judge district court denied Citizens United's motion for a preliminary injunction, 530 F. Supp. 2d 274 (D.D.C. 2008) (*per curiam*), and granted summary judgment to the Federal Election Commission (FEC), App. 261a–262a. Citizens United appealed directly to the Supreme Court under BCRA § 403(a).

### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Court addressed: (1) whether 2 U.S.C. § 441b (as amended by BCRA § 203) is facially valid under the First Amendment or unconstitutional as applied to *Hillary* and the ads promoting it, including whether the Court should overrule *Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce*, 494 U.S. 652 (1990) (upholding restrictions on corporate independent expenditures based on corporate identity), and the part of *McConnell v. Federal Election Comm'n*, 540 U.S. 93, 203–209 (2003), upholding BCRA § 203's extension of § 441b; (2) whether narrower grounds resolved the case without overruling *Austin*, such as whether *Hillary* qualifies as an "electioneering communication" under § 441b(b)(2) and 11 C.F.R. § 100.29, whether § 441b applies under *Federal Election Comm'n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.*, 551 U.S. 449 (2007) (*WRTL*), whether video-on-demand poses less risk of distortion than television ads, or whether a nonprofit corporate exception applies; and (3) whether BCRA §§ 201 and 311 (disclosure and disclaimer requirements) are constitutional as applied to *Hillary* and the ads.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Court (in a 5-4 opinion by Justice Kennedy, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Scalia and Alito; Justice Thomas joined all but Part IV) held that § 441b's prohibitions on corporate and union independent expenditures for electioneering communications or express advocacy are facially invalid under the First Amendment and overruled *Austin* and the relevant part of *McConnell* upholding BCRA § 203. Political speech is central to the First Amendment and subject to strict scrutiny, requiring the Government to prove a restriction furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored; no such interest justifies suppressing corporate political speech based on speaker identity. The Court rejected narrower grounds as unsustainable and found resolving the case without facial review would chill speech due to § 441b's complexity and the need for prior FEC permission. *Austin*'s "antidistortion" rationale (preventing distorting effects of corporate wealth) was rejected as inconsistent with First Amendment protections for corporate speech (*e.g.*, *First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti*, 435 U.S. 765 (1978); *Buckley v. Valeo*, 424 U.S. 1 (1976) (*per curiam*)); independent expenditures do not corrupt or appear to corrupt (*Buckley*, 424 U.S. at 47); shareholder protection and foreign influence interests were under- and overinclusive; *stare decisis* factors (antiquity, reliance, workability) favored overruling *Austin*. PACs do not alleviate § 441b's burdens. The Court upheld BCRA §§ 201 and 311 as applied to the ads and *Hillary* under exacting scrutiny, as they impose no ceiling on speech and advance a sufficiently important informational interest without evidence of threats or harassment to Citizens United's donors (*Buckley*, 424 U.S. at 66, 76; *McConnell*, 540 U.S. at 196). Judgment reversed in part, affirmed in part, and remanded. Precedent: Corporations and unions may make unlimited independent expenditures from general treasury funds; overrules *Austin* and *McConnell* on corporate/union independent expenditures; upholds disclosure/disclaimer requirements.
