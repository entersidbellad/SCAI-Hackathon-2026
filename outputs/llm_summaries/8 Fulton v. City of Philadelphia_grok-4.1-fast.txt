### 1. Facts of the Case
Petitioners Sharonell Fulton et al., including Catholic Social Services (CSS) and three affiliated foster parents, challenged the City of Philadelphia's refusal to refer children to CSS or renew its foster care contract unless CSS agreed to certify same-sex married couples as foster parents. Philadelphia's foster care system relies on contracts with private agencies, including CSS, which has provided services for over 50 years under Pennsylvania statutory criteria (55 Pa. Code §§3700.61, 3700.64, 3700.69). CSS holds the religious belief that marriage is a sacred bond between one man and one woman and thus will not certify unmarried couples (regardless of sexual orientation) or same-sex married couples, viewing certification as an endorsement of relationships; it certifies gay or lesbian individuals as single foster parents and refers same-sex couples to over 20 other agencies that certify them. No same-sex couple has sought certification from CSS. In 2018, following a newspaper story on the Archdiocese of Philadelphia's position, the City Council called for investigation, the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations inquired, and the Department of Human Services Commissioner met with CSS leadership before halting referrals, citing violations of contract non-discrimination provisions (§3.21, allowing exceptions at Commissioner's "sole discretion," and §15.1) and the Fair Practices Ordinance (Phila. Code §9–1106(1), prohibiting discrimination in public accommodations, §9–1102(1)(w)). CSS and foster parents filed suit alleging Free Exercise and Free Speech violations under the First Amendment, seeking to enjoin the referral freeze. The District Court denied preliminary relief, holding the contract and Ordinance neutral and generally applicable under Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872 (1990) (320 F. Supp. 3d 661 (ED Pa. 2018)). The Third Circuit affirmed post-contract expiration, finding proposed renewal terms neutral and generally applicable under Smith (922 F. 3d 140 (CA3 2019)). The Supreme Court granted certiorari (589 U. S. ___ (2020)) to review the Third Circuit's application of Smith and whether to reconsider Smith.

### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Court addressed whether Philadelphia's refusal to contract with CSS for foster care services unless CSS certifies same-sex couples violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, specifically whether the City's contractual non-discrimination requirement (§3.21 and §15.1) and Fair Practices Ordinance are neutral and generally applicable under Smith, 494 U. S. 872 (neutral laws incidentally burdening religion not subject to strict scrutiny), or trigger strict scrutiny per Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520 (1993) (laws not generally applicable if allowing individualized exemptions, Smith, 494 U. S. at 884). Petitioners also challenged Smith's validity.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Court unanimously reversed the Third Circuit (922 F. 3d 140) and remanded (6-3 majority opinion by Roberts, C.J., joined by Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan, Kavanaugh, Barrett, JJ.). Philadelphia's actions violate the Free Exercise Clause. The contractual non-discrimination requirement burdens CSS's religious exercise (forcing curtailment of mission or violation of beliefs) and is not generally applicable due to §3.21's discretionary exceptions at the Commissioner's "sole discretion," inviting individualized assessments and prohibiting refusal of religious hardship exemptions without compelling reason (Smith, 494 U. S. at 884; Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398 (1963)); state law prevents interpreting §15.1 to nullify §3.21's exceptions (Shehadi v. Northeastern Nat. Bank of Pa., 474 Pa. 232 (1977)). Strict scrutiny applies (Lukumi, 508 U. S. at 546): City lacks compelling interest in denying CSS an exception, as CSS seeks only accommodation to serve children consistent with beliefs without imposing them on others, increasing (not reducing) foster parents, posing no liability risk (certification authority state-delegated, 55 Pa. Code §3700.61), and undermining equal treatment claims via exceptions. The Fair Practices Ordinance does not apply, as foster certification is not "made available to the public" (Phila. Code §9–1102(1)(w); selective, customized process unlike hotels/restaurants). No need to address Free Speech or overrule Smith. Barrett, J., concurred (joined by Kavanaugh, J.; Breyer, J., except first paragraph), noting strict scrutiny applies regardless of Smith due to discretionary exceptions. Alito, J., concurred in judgment (joined by Thomas, Gorsuch, JJ.), urging Smith overruling. Gorsuch, J., concurred in judgment (joined by Thomas, Alito, JJ.), criticizing avoidance of Smith. Precedent: Reiterates Smith exceptions for non-generally applicable policies (individualized exemptions trigger strict scrutiny); clarifies foster certification not public accommodation.
