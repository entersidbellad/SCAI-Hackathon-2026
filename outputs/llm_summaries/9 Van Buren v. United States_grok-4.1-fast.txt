### 1. Facts of the Case
Nathan Van Buren, a former police sergeant with the Wrens, Georgia Police Department, developed a relationship with Andrew Albo, whom the deputy chief had warned officers to handle carefully as "very volatile." Van Buren asked Albo for a personal loan, which Albo secretly recorded and reported to the local sheriff's office as a shakedown. The FBI then conducted a sting operation in which Albo asked Van Buren to use the state law enforcement database—accessible via his patrol-car computer—to run a license plate number purportedly belonging to a woman Albo met at a strip club, to check if she was an undercover officer. Albo offered Van Buren approximately $5,000. Van Buren, using his valid credentials, accessed the database (which contained an FBI-created entry) and retrieved the information, violating department policy trained against "personal use" or "improper purpose" not connected to law enforcement. Van Buren was charged with a felony violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 (CFAA), 18 U.S.C. §1030(a)(2), for intentionally accessing a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access. A jury convicted him, and the District Court sentenced him to 18 months' imprisonment. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, holding that accessing the database for an "inappropriate reason" violated the CFAA consistent with circuit precedent, 940 F. 3d 1192 (2019). The Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve a circuit split on the scope of the "exceeds authorized access" clause.

### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Court addressed whether Van Buren violated 18 U.S.C. §1030(a)(2), which criminalizes intentionally accessing a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access to obtain information, where "exceeds authorized access" is defined in §1030(e)(6) as "to access a computer with authorization and to use such access to obtain or alter information in the computer that the accesser is not entitled so to obtain or alter." Specifically, the Court examined whether this provision applies only to obtaining information from areas of a computer (e.g., files, folders, or databases) to which the user's authorization does not extend (a "gates-up-or-down" inquiry), or also to misusing otherwise authorized access for an improper purpose in violation of employer policy.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Court reversed the Eleventh Circuit in a 6-3 decision (opinion by Justice Barrett, joined by Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh; dissent by Justice Thomas, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito) and remanded. Van Buren did not violate the CFAA because he accessed the database with authorization using valid credentials and was entitled to obtain license-plate information from it, notwithstanding his improper purpose. The Court held that "exceeds authorized access" under §1030(e)(6) covers only those who obtain information from particular off-limits areas of an authorized computer, not those who misuse access to otherwise available information.

**Reasoning**: (1) Text: The parties agreed Van Buren accessed a protected computer with authorization and obtained information; the dispute turned on "not entitled so to obtain." "So" is a term of reference to the prior manner stated—obtaining information via an authorized computer—meaning entitlement is assessed based on access rights to the information's location, not purpose (citing Black’s Law Dictionary 1246 (5th ed. 1979)). The Government's broader reading of "so" (any circumstance-based limits) lacks textual support and renders "so" a hook for external restrictions. "So" is not superfluous, as it clarifies digital access entitlement and forecloses non-computer defenses. The dissent's focus on "entitled" as circumstance-dependent ignores its modification by "so to obtain." Ordinary meaning of "exceeds authorized access" yields to the statutory definition, consistent with "access" as entry in computing contexts. (2) Structure: §1030(a)(2) distinguishes "without authorization" (outside hackers) from "exceeds authorized access" (inside hackers entering restricted areas within authorized systems), both via gates-up-or-down inquiries; the Government's purpose-based reading creates inconsistency. Civil remedies under §1030(g) focus on technological "damage" or "loss" (§§1030(e)(8), (11)), fitting hacking harms, not misuse of accessible data. (3) Precedent and history: Musacchio v. United States, 577 U.S. 237 (2016), did not resolve the issue (dicta only); Congress's 1986 removal of the 1984 Act's explicit "purpose" language (§1030(a)(2), 98 Stat. 2191) cuts against purpose-based liability. (4) Implications: The Government's view would criminalize commonplace activity (e.g., personal emails on work computers, terms-of-service violations) and inject arbitrariness based on policy phrasing. The ruling sets precedent narrowing CFAA liability to unauthorized entry or off-limits areas, not improper use.
