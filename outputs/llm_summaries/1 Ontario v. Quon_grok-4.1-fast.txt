### 1. Facts of the Case
The City of Ontario, California (City), Ontario Police Department (OPD), and OPD Chief Lloyd Scharf (petitioners) issued alphanumeric pagers capable of sending and receiving text messages to OPD SWAT team members, including respondent Jeff Quon, a police sergeant, in October 2001. The City's contract with Arch Wireless Operating Company limited each pager to 25,000 characters per month, with overages incurring additional fees. The City's Computer Usage, Internet and E-Mail Policy, acknowledged by Quon in March 2000, stated that users had no expectation of privacy in City computer resources, and OPD informed employees, including at an April 18, 2002, meeting attended by Quon and in a Chief Scharf memorandum dated April 29, 2002, that pager text messages were treated as e-mails subject to auditing. Quon exceeded his character limit multiple times starting in the first or second billing cycle, reimbursing the City each time after Lieutenant Steven Duke suggested this alternative to auditing. In August and September 2002, Quon and another officer again exceeded limits. In October 2002, Chief Scharf, tired of collecting overage fees, directed Duke to obtain transcripts from Arch Wireless to determine if the character limit was too low (requiring officers to pay for work-related messages) or if overages were personal. Arch Wireless provided transcripts after verifying the City as subscriber. Review by Duke, Scharf, and Quon's supervisor revealed many non-work-related and sexually explicit messages from Quon. Scharf referred the matter to OPD internal affairs; Sergeant Patrick McMahon redacted off-duty messages using Quon's work schedule and found that of 456 work-hour messages in August 2002, no more than 57 were work-related, leading to Quon's discipline for violating OPD rules.

Respondents Jeff Quon, Jerilyn Quon (his then-separated wife), April Florio (OPD employee romantically involved with Jeff Quon), and Steve Trujillo (OPD SWAT member), each of whom exchanged texts with Jeff Quon in August and September 2002, sued petitioners, Arch Wireless, and another individual under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (Fourth Amendment), 18 U.S.C. § 2701 et seq. (Stored Communications Act, SCA), and California law, alleging violations by obtaining and reviewing Jeff Quon's transcripts. The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California denied respondents summary judgment on Fourth Amendment claims, found via jury that Scharf's purpose was legitimate (efficacy of limits, not time-wasting), and granted petitioners summary judgment, citing O’Connor v. Ortega, 480 U.S. 709 (1987). The Ninth Circuit reversed in part, Quon v. Arch Wireless Operating Co., 529 F. 3d 892 (2008), holding the search unreasonable in scope despite legitimate rationale and that Arch Wireless violated the SCA; rehearing en banc denied, 554 F. 3d 769 (2009). The Supreme Court granted certiorari on petitioners' Fourth Amendment claims, 558 U.S. 1090 (2009), but denied Arch Wireless's petition on the SCA, USA Mobility Wireless, Inc. v. Quon, 558 U.S. 1091 (2009).

### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Court addressed whether petitioners violated respondents' Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures by obtaining and reviewing transcripts of text messages sent and received on Jeff Quon's City-issued pager. The Court examined the analytical framework from O’Connor v. Ortega for government employer searches, including whether Jeff Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his pager messages (considering the Computer Policy, OPD notices, and Duke's statements), whether petitioners' review constituted a Fourth Amendment search, and whether the warrantless search was reasonable under the O’Connor plurality's two-step approach (operational realities of workplace for privacy expectation; then reasonableness under all circumstances for noninvestigatory work-related purposes or work-misconduct investigations) or Justice Scalia's concurrence (government offices generally protected, but searches reasonable/normal in private-employer context do not violate the Fourth Amendment). The Court also considered whether the search's reasonableness turned on Chief Scharf's intent or a "least intrusive means" test, and whether it extended unreasonably to messages sent to Jeff Quon by other respondents.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit, 529 F. 3d 892, holding that petitioners did not violate respondents' Fourth Amendment rights because the search of Jeff Quon's pager transcripts was reasonable. Justice Kennedy's opinion (joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Stevens, Thomas, Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito, and Sotomayor; Justice Scalia joined except Part III-A) assumed arguendo that Jeff Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy, that the review was a Fourth Amendment search, and that O’Connor v. Ortega principles apply to employer-provided electronic devices. Under the O’Connor plurality, 480 U.S. at 725-726, the search was justified at inception (jury-found legitimate work-related purpose: determining if 25,000-character limit met City needs and avoided officers paying for work messages or City subsidizing personal use); reasonable in scope (efficient/expedient review of only August-September 2002 transcripts for sample size; off-duty messages redacted by McMahon); and not excessively intrusive (Quon's limited privacy expectation as SWAT officer aware of auditing policy and scrutiny needs; less intrusive than personal email/wiretap). It satisfied Justice Scalia's approach, 480 U.S. at 732, as reasonable/normal in private-employer context. The Ninth Circuit erred by applying a "least intrusive means" test, rejected in Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 663 (1995), and cases like Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives’ Assn., 489 U.S. 602 (1989). SCA issues were not before the Court and did not render the search per se unreasonable. Other respondents could not prevail, as they argued the search unreasonable only if unreasonable as to Jeff Quon. Justice Stevens concurred, noting no resolution of O’Connor framework and Quon's limited expectation. Justice Scalia concurred in judgment/part, rejecting O’Connor plurality's "operational realities" as standardless and unnecessary here. Precedent: Government employer searches of employee electronic communications are evaluated for reasonableness under O’Connor even assuming privacy expectations; courts should avoid broad rules on evolving technology/workplace norms; no "least intrusive means" requirement. Remanded for further proceedings.
