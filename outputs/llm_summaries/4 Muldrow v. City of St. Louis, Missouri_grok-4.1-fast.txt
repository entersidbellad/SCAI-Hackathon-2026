### 1. Facts of the Case
Sergeant Jatonya Clayborn Muldrow, a plainclothes officer in the St. Louis Police Department's Intelligence Division from 2008 to 2017, investigated public corruption and human trafficking cases, oversaw the Gang Unit, served as head of the Gun Crimes Unit, and was deputized as a Task Force Officer with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which provided her FBI credentials, an unmarked take-home vehicle, and authority to pursue investigations outside St. Louis. In 2017, the new Intelligence Division commander, Captain Michael Deeba, requested Muldrow's transfer to replace her with a male officer, referring to her as "Mrs." rather than "Sergeant" and testifying that the male officer was a better fit for the Division's "very dangerous" work. The Department approved the involuntary transfer over Muldrow's objections, reassigning her to a uniformed supervisory position in the Fifth District. Her rank and pay remained unchanged, but her responsibilities shifted from working with high-ranking officials on departmental priorities to supervising neighborhood patrol officers' day-to-day activities (including approving arrests, reviewing reports, and handling administrative matters, with some patrol work herself); she lost her FBI deputization and take-home vehicle; and her schedule changed from a regular Monday-through-Friday week to a rotating schedule often involving weekend shifts. Muldrow filed suit against the City of St. Louis, Missouri, and others under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §2000e–2(a)(1), alleging sex discrimination with respect to the terms or conditions of her employment. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri granted summary judgment to the City (2020 WL 5505113), holding that Muldrow failed to show a "significant" change producing "material employment disadvantage" under Circuit precedent. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed (30 F. 4th 680), concluding the transfer caused no "materially significant disadvantage" as it involved no change in title, salary, or benefits and only "minor changes in working conditions," with Muldrow retaining a supervisory role involving serious crime investigations. The Supreme Court granted certiorari (600 U.S. ___ (2023)) to resolve a Circuit split on whether Title VII transfer claims require a heightened harm threshold.

### 2. Legal Question(s)
Whether, to prevail on a Title VII discrimination claim challenging an involuntary job transfer under 42 U.S.C. §2000e–2(a)(1)—which makes it unlawful to "discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s . . . sex"—an employee must demonstrate that the transfer caused a "significant," "material," "serious," or similarly heightened level of harm or disadvantage to an identifiable term or condition of employment, beyond merely showing some injurious or disadvantageous change in such a term or condition.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Supreme Court vacated the Eighth Circuit's judgment and remanded in a 6-3 decision (No. 22–193, decided April 17, 2024; cite as 601 U.S. ____ (2024)), with Justice Kagan writing for the Court (joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Sotomayor, Gorsuch, Barrett, and Jackson); Justices Thomas, Alito, and Kavanaugh each filed separate opinions concurring in the judgment. The Court held that a Title VII plaintiff challenging a discriminatory job transfer must show some harm or injurious change respecting an identifiable term or condition of employment (e.g., responsibilities, perks, or schedule), but need not meet any heightened "significance," "materiality," or similar threshold, as such a requirement adds words to the statutory text. The Court reasoned that §2000e–2(a)(1)'s prohibition on "discriminat[ing] against" an individual "with respect to" employment "terms [or] conditions" because of sex (citing Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 80 (1998); Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644, 657, 658, 681 (2020); Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 64 (1986)) requires only "differences in treatment that injure" employees tied to such terms or conditions, without textual support for an elevated harm bar that could exclude non-"significant" injuries. The Court rejected the City's ejusdem generis argument (comparing "fail or refuse to hire," "discharge," or "otherwise . . . discriminate against"), noting the provision's parts share the trait of being employment actions rather than requiring equivalent harm levels. It distinguished Burlington Northern & Santa Fe R. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 63, 68 (2006), which imposed a "materially adverse" (significant harm) standard for Title VII's separate anti-retaliation provision (§2000e–3(a)) to deter only actions dissuading reasonable workers from filing charges—a rationale inapplicable to the anti-discrimination provision's flat prevention of status-based injury. Policy concerns about flooding courts were dismissed, as courts can filter meritless claims via requirements of injury to terms/conditions, discriminatory intent ("because of" sex), forfeiture, and proof; Congress could have added a significance limit if desired (citing EEOC v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc., 575 U.S. 768, 774 (2015)). Muldrow's allegations—if properly preserved and proven—satisfied the correct standard, as the transfer worsened her terms/conditions in multiple ways (e.g., from plainclothes Intelligence Division role with priority investigations, networking, regular schedule, and take-home vehicle to uniformed patrol supervision with administrative focus, irregular weekends, and lost vehicle), regardless of unchanged rank/pay. Issues of forfeiture (e.g., District Court's note that Muldrow did not argue schedule/vehicle changes against summary judgment; 2020 WL 5505113, *9, n.20) and evidentiary support were left for remand under the proper standard. The decision rejected heightened-harm precedents in Circuits including the Eighth (e.g., 30 F. 4th 680), First, Second, Fourth, Seventh, Tenth, and Eleventh, aligning with the D.C. Circuit's en banc ruling in Chambers v. District of Columbia, 35 F. 4th 870 (2022).
