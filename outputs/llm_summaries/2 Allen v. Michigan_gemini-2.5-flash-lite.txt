## Allen v. Milligan: Summary of Supreme Court Opinion

### 1. Facts of the Case

Following the 2020 decennial census, the State of Alabama redrew its congressional district map, enacting it as House Bill 1 (HB1). A group of Alabama citizens, including Evan Milligan and Marcus Caster, filed lawsuits challenging HB1. They argued that the new map, which continued to produce only one district where Black voters constituted a majority, likely violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) of 1965 and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The plaintiffs contended that Alabama's population growth necessitated the creation of a second majority-Black congressional district, given the state's demographics and history of racial discrimination in voting. A three-judge District Court convened to hear the cases. After an extensive evidentiary hearing, the District Court preliminarily enjoined Alabama from using HB1 in the upcoming congressional elections, finding that the plaintiffs demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of success on their Section 2 claim. The Supreme Court granted review of this decision.

### 2. Legal Question(s)

The primary legal question before the Supreme Court was whether the congressional districting plan adopted by the State of Alabama (HB1) likely violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. §10301. This question involved an examination of how Section 2, as amended in 1982, is applied to redistricting challenges, particularly concerning the *Gingles* framework and the concept of "reasonably configured" districts. The Court also considered Alabama's arguments for a "race-neutral benchmark" approach and whether Section 2 applies to single-member districts.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding

The Supreme Court affirmed the District Court's determination, holding that the plaintiffs demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of success on their claim that Alabama's redistricting plan (HB1) violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.

The Court's reasoning was as follows:

*   **Application of the *Gingles* Framework:** The Court reiterated that for the past 37 years, it has evaluated Section 2 claims using the three-part framework established in *Thornburg v. Gingles*, 478 U. S. 30 (1986). This framework requires plaintiffs to show: (1) the minority group is large and geographically compact enough to form a majority in a reasonably configured district; (2) the minority group is politically cohesive; and (3) the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to defeat the minority's preferred candidate. If these preconditions are met, the court must then consider the "totality of circumstances" to determine if the political processes are equally open to minority voters.
*   **First *Gingles* Precondition:** The Court agreed with the District Court that Black voters in Alabama could constitute a majority in a second, "reasonably configured" district. The plaintiffs presented eleven illustrative maps that contained two majority-Black districts while adhering to traditional districting criteria like compactness, contiguity, and respect for political subdivisions. The Court found Alabama's arguments against these maps, such as their alleged failure to preserve the Gulf Coast region as a community of interest, unpersuasive.
*   **Second and Third *Gingles* Preconditions:** The Court affirmed the District Court's finding that there was "no serious dispute" that Black voters in Alabama are politically cohesive and that the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to defeat their preferred candidates, citing statistical evidence of racial polarization.
*   **Totality of Circumstances:** The District Court's conclusion that the totality of circumstances demonstrated a Section 2 violation was also affirmed, based on the racial polarization of elections, the lack of Black success in statewide elections, and Alabama's history of racial discrimination.
*   **Rejection of Alabama's "Race-Neutral Benchmark" Theory:** The Court rejected Alabama's proposal to use a "race-neutral benchmark" derived from computer-generated maps as the primary basis for Section 2 analysis. The Court found this approach inconsistent with its precedent, which focuses on illustrative maps presented by plaintiffs and the totality of circumstances, rather than a statistical average of hypothetical maps. The Court also noted that Alabama's proposed benchmark would require novel and unworkable evidentiary standards.
*   **No Requirement for Proportionality:** The Court clarified that the *Gingles* framework does not mandate racial proportionality in districting, as prohibited by Section 2(b). Instead, it constrains proportionality by requiring adherence to traditional districting principles like compactness and contiguity, as demonstrated in prior cases like *Shaw v. Reno* and *Miller v. Johnson*.
*   **Applicability to Single-Member Districts:** The Court reaffirmed its unanimous precedent that Section 2 and the *Gingles* framework apply to challenges involving single-member districts.
*   **Constitutional Arguments:** The Court rejected Alabama's argument that Section 2 as applied to redistricting is unconstitutional, citing prior decisions that upheld Congress's authority to ban electoral changes discriminatory in effect as a method of promoting the Fifteenth Amendment's purposes.

**Precedent Set:** The decision reaffirms the continued validity and application of the *Gingles* framework for analyzing Section 2 Voting Rights Act claims in redistricting cases. It underscores that while race can be a consideration in districting, it cannot be the predominant factor, and that the VRA prohibits districting plans that dilute minority voting strength, even without proof of discriminatory intent. The Court also reinforced that the analysis requires a holistic review of circumstances, not solely reliance on statistical benchmarks.
