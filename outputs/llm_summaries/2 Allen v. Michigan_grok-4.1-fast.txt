### 1. Facts of the Case
Alabama's congressional districting map (HB1), enacted in 2021 following the 2020 decennial census showing 5.1% population growth, created seven single-member districts with only one majority-black voting-age population district (District 7), despite black voters comprising approximately 27% of the state's population and 25.9% of its voting-age population. The map largely resembled the prior 2011 map, which traced back to a 1992 map resulting from Wesch v. Hunt, 785 F. Supp. 1491 (SD Ala.), aff'd sub nom. Camp v. Wesch, 504 U.S. 902 (1992), that established Alabama's first majority-black congressional district since 1877.

Three groups of plaintiffs challenged HB1: (1) the Caster plaintiffs, led by Marcus Caster (Caster v. Allen, No. 21–1087), alleging a §2 Voting Rights Act (VRA) violation, 52 U.S.C. §10301; (2) the Milligan plaintiffs, led by Evan Milligan (Milligan v. Merrill, consolidated with Singleton v. Merrill, No. 21–1086), alleging §2 and Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause violations; and (3) the Singleton plaintiffs, led by Bobby Singleton, alleging racial gerrymandering under the Equal Protection Clause. A three-judge District Court (Northern District of Alabama) consolidated Milligan and Singleton for preliminary injunction proceedings and held a hearing with 17 witnesses, over 1,000 pages of briefing, and 350 exhibits. In a 227-page opinion (582 F. Supp. 3d 924 (ND Ala. 2022) (per curiam)), the court found HB1 likely violated §2 under Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30 (1986), and enjoined its use; Judge Manasco issued similar relief in Caster. Alabama appealed to the Supreme Court, which stayed the injunction (595 U.S. ___ (2022)) and noted probable jurisdiction in Milligan while granting certiorari before judgment in Caster from the Eleventh Circuit.

### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Court addressed whether Alabama's HB1 congressional districting map likely violated §2 of the VRA, 52 U.S.C. §10301, which prohibits voting qualifications, prerequisites, standards, practices, or procedures imposed in a manner resulting in denial or abridgment of the right to vote on account of race or color, such that political processes are not equally open to minority voters who have less opportunity than others to participate and elect representatives of their choice. The Court applied the Gingles framework's three preconditions and totality-of-circumstances test: (1) whether black voters were sufficiently large and geographically compact for a majority in a reasonably configured district; (2) political cohesion; and (3) white bloc voting usually defeating black-preferred candidates.

Subsidiary questions included: (a) whether plaintiffs' illustrative maps satisfied the first Gingles precondition as reasonably configured under traditional districting criteria (e.g., compactness, contiguity, equal population, respecting political subdivisions, communities of interest); (b) Alabama's "race-neutral benchmark" theory, requiring comparison to race-blind simulated maps rather than plaintiffs' illustrative maps; (c) whether §2 applies to single-member districting challenges; and (d) whether §2, as applied via Gingles to require race-conscious remedies, exceeds Congress's Fifteenth Amendment enforcement authority.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Court affirmed the District Court's determination that plaintiffs demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of success on their §2 claim, holding HB1 violates §2 under Gingles. Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion (joined fully by Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson; Justice Kavanaugh joined except Part III–B–1).

**Reasoning**: The District Court faithfully applied Gingles. Plaintiffs satisfied the first precondition: eleven illustrative maps (e.g., by experts Moon Duchin and Bill Cooper) showed black voters could form a majority in a second reasonably configured district, performing as well as or better than HB1 on compactness, contiguity, equal population, and political subdivisions (e.g., splitting fewer or equal county lines), while respecting communities of interest like the Black Belt; Gulf Coast arguments failed for lack of evidence. Second and third preconditions were undisputed: black voters cohesive (92.3% support for preferred candidates); white bloc voting (15.4% support) defeats them. Totality of circumstances supported violation due to racial polarization, black statewide electoral failure, racial campaign appeals, socioeconomic disparities, and Alabama's history of racial/voting discrimination (e.g., Senate factors from Gingles, 478 U.S. at 36–37).

The Court rejected Alabama's race-neutral benchmark (e.g., Duchin/Imai simulations yielding no two majority-black districts): it revises Gingles, ignores §2 text requiring equal openness (not resemblance to race-blind maps), risks proportionality (expressly disclaimed in §2(b)), imposes novel burdens (e.g., proving deviations "only" by race, intent-like standard rejected post-City of Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55 (1980)), and is unworkable given trillions of maps and contestable metrics. Gingles constrains proportionality via traditional criteria (e.g., Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630 (1993); Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900 (1995); Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. 952 (1996)). Illustrative maps need not be race-blind if race does not predominate (Miller, 515 U.S. at 916). §2 applies to single-member districts (e.g., Growe v. Emison, 507 U.S. 25 (1993)); unconstitutional as-applied claim fails (City of Rome v. United States, 446 U.S. 156 (1980)).

**Precedent Set**: Reaffirms Gingles framework (37 years unchanged by Congress) governs §2 claims, including single-member redistricting; plaintiffs' illustrative maps (not race-neutral benchmarks) establish first precondition if reasonably configured without race predominance; totality requires "intensely local appraisal"; §2 effects test (not intent) applies without proportionality mandate or novel evidentiary burdens. Remand for remedy implied, but injunction affirmed pending further proceedings.
