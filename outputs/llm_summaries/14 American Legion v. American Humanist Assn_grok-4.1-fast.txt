### 1. Facts of the Case
In 1918, residents of Prince George’s County, Maryland, formed a committee to erect a memorial honoring the county’s soldiers who died in World War I. The committee selected a plain Latin cross as the design, a symbol associated with the war due to images of white crosses marking soldiers’ graves overseas. Funded by private donations, the 32-foot-tall concrete Latin cross was completed in 1925 by the local American Legion post after the committee exhausted funds. The cross sits on a pedestal displaying the American Legion emblem, the words “Valor,” “Endurance,” “Courage,” and “Devotion,” and a bronze plaque listing the names of 49 county soldiers who died in the war, along with dates of U.S. involvement and a quote from President Woodrow Wilson. The dedication ceremony included an invocation by a Catholic priest and a benediction by a Baptist pastor. The cross has since been the site of patriotic events on Veterans Day, Memorial Day, and Independence Day, and is now in Veterans Memorial Park amid monuments to veterans of other wars. As the surrounding area developed into a busy intersection, the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (Commission) acquired the cross and surrounding land in 1961 to preserve the monument and address traffic safety, reserving the American Legion’s right to use the site for ceremonies. The Commission has since spent public funds, including approximately $117,000 over five decades and a budgeted $100,000 in 2008, to maintain it.

In 2014, the American Humanist Association (AHA) and three individuals filed suit against the Commission in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, alleging that the cross’s presence on public land and the Commission’s maintenance violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The American Legion intervened as a defendant. The District Court granted summary judgment for the Commission and American Legion, finding the cross satisfied the Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971), test and Justice Breyer’s analysis in Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U.S. 677 (2005). The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed, 874 F. 3d 195 (2017), holding the cross failed Lemon’s “effects” prong as a reasonable observer would perceive endorsement of Christianity and created excessive entanglement. The Fourth Circuit denied rehearing en banc. The American Legion and Commission petitioned for certiorari, which the Supreme Court granted and consolidated, 586 U.S. ___ (2018).

### 2. Legal Question(s)
Does the government’s ownership and maintenance of the Bladensburg Cross—a 32-foot-tall Latin cross on public land commemorating World War I soldiers—violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment?

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Supreme Court reversed the Fourth Circuit’s judgment and remanded in a judgment announced by Justice Alito, with Parts I, II-B, II-C, III, and IV of his opinion joined by Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Breyer, Justice Kagan, and Justice Kavanaugh, and Parts II-A and II-D joined by Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Breyer, and Justice Kavanaugh (effectively 5-4 on key parts). The Court held the Bladensburg Cross does not violate the Establishment Clause.

Justice Alito’s plurality opinion concluded that longstanding religious monuments, symbols, and practices warrant a strong presumption of constitutionality due to four considerations distinguishing them from new ones: (1) difficulty ascertaining original purposes due to age (citing Salazar v. Buono, 559 U.S. 700 (2010)); (2) multiplication and evolution of purposes over time, potentially obscuring religious origins in favor of historical or cultural significance (citing Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U.S. 677; McCreary County v. American Civil Liberties Union of Ky., 545 U.S. 844 (2005); Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U.S. 460 (2009)); (3) transformation of meaning through familiarity (e.g., city names like Bethlehem, Pennsylvania; Arizona’s motto “Ditat Deus”; Maryland’s flag); and (4) non-neutral appearance of removal, evoking hostility to religion. Applied here, the cross’s association with World War I—via grave markers, Distinguished Service Cross (1918), Navy Cross (1919), and poetry like John McCrae’s “In Flanders Fields”—gave it secular meaning as a symbol of sacrifice, reinforced by its age (94 years), integration into the community amid other veterans’ memorials, lack of discriminatory intent (names of Black and White soldiers included; Jewish veteran involved; ecumenical dedication amid 1920s Klan activity), and role commemorating specific deaths akin to faith symbols in other memorials (e.g., Martin Luther King, Jr. memorials; Holocaust memorials with Stars of David). Parts II-A and II-D critiqued Lemon v. Kurtzman’s purpose/effects/entanglement test as unworkable and abandoned in cases like Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills Sch. Dist., 509 U.S. 1 (1993); Town of Greece v. Galloway, 572 U.S. 565 (2014); instead favoring a history-and-tradition approach exemplified by Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.S. 783 (1983) (legislative prayer).

Justice Breyer concurred (joined by Justice Kagan), agreeing no single formula resolves Establishment Clause cases and upholding based on context: cross’s WWI association, secular motives, lack of exclusion, placement among secular memorials, 94-year history without controversy. Justice Kavanaugh concurred, applying history-and-tradition test, rejecting Lemon across categories, and outlining principles (non-coercive, rooted in history/tradition, equal treatment, or accommodations). Justice Thomas concurred in the judgment, arguing the Clause is not incorporated against states (citing Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1 (1947)); no coercion (historical establishments involved orthodoxy/financial penalties); religious displays need not be nonsectarian (citing Town of Greece); and overruling Lemon entirely. Justice Gorsuch concurred in the judgment (joined by Justice Thomas), urging dismissal for lack of standing as “offended observer” theory lacks basis (citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555 (1992); Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, 454 U.S. 464 (1982)); tied to Lemon, now shelved.

Justices Ginsburg (joined by Justice Sotomayor) dissented, arguing the cross endorses Christianity (citing County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U.S. 573 (1989)), unmitigated by context, history, or war memorial purpose.

The decision sets precedent favoring history, tradition, and context over Lemon for longstanding religious monuments/symbols/practices, presuming their constitutionality absent coercion or discrimination, while preserving case-by-case analysis.
