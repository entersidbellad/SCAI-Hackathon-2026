### 1. Facts of the Case
Petitioner Rose Mary Knick owns a 90-acre rural property in Scott Township, Pennsylvania, north of Scranton, which includes her single-family home, grazing areas for horses and farm animals, and a small family graveyard containing ancestors of her neighbors. In December 2012, the Township of Scott passed Ordinance No. 2012–01, requiring that "[a]ll cemeteries . . . be kept open and accessible to the general public during daylight hours," defining a "cemetery" as "[a] place or area of ground, whether contained on private or public property, which has been set apart for or otherwise utilized as a burial place for deceased human beings," and authorizing Township code enforcement officers to "enter upon any property" to determine the existence and location of a cemetery.

In 2013, a Township officer discovered grave markers on Knick's property and notified her of a violation for failing to open the cemetery to the public during daylight hours. Knick filed suit in Pennsylvania state court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging the ordinance effected a taking of her property without just compensation under the Fifth Amendment, but she did not pursue an inverse condemnation action under Pennsylvania law, 26 Pa. Cons. Stat. §502(c) (2009). The Township withdrew the violation notice and stayed enforcement of the ordinance pending the state proceedings. The state court declined to rule on Knick's request, holding she could not demonstrate irreparable harm absent an ongoing enforcement action.

Knick then filed a complaint under 42 U.S.C. §1983 in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, alleging the ordinance violated the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The District Court dismissed the claim as unripe under Williamson County Regional Planning Comm’n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U.S. 172 (1985), which required property owners to seek compensation through state inverse condemnation procedures before filing a federal takings claim. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed, noting the ordinance was "extraordinary and constitutionally suspect" but bound by Williamson County, 862 F.3d 310 (2017). The Supreme Court granted certiorari, 583 U.S. ___ (2018), argued October 3, 2018, reargued January 16, 2019, and decided June 21, 2019.

### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Court addressed whether a property owner may bring a Fifth Amendment Takings Clause claim under 42 U.S.C. §1983 immediately upon a government taking of property without just compensation, or whether, as held in Williamson County Regional Planning Comm’n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U.S. 172 (1985), such a federal claim is premature until the owner has sought and been denied compensation through available state procedures, such as an inverse condemnation action. The Court specifically reconsidered Williamson County's state-litigation requirement, examining its consistency with Takings Clause precedents (e.g., Jacobs v. United States, 290 U.S. 13 (1933); First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U.S. 304 (1987)); its practical consequences, including the preclusive effect under San Remo Hotel, L.P. v. City and County of San Francisco, 545 U.S. 323 (2005), and 28 U.S.C. §1738; and whether it imposed an unjustifiable exhaustion requirement contrary to §1983 jurisprudence (e.g., Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla., 457 U.S. 496 (1982); Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994)).

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Supreme Court held, in a 5-4 decision, that a government violates the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment when it takes property for public use without just compensation, and a property owner may bring a §1983 claim in federal court at that time without first pursuing state remedies. The Court overruled Williamson County’s state-litigation requirement as poorly reasoned, unworkable, and inconsistent with longstanding Takings Clause jurisprudence.

The Court reasoned that the Takings Clause is self-executing, providing a constitutional right to compensation immediately upon an uncompensated taking, as affirmed in Jacobs v. United States, 290 U.S. 13 (1933) (compensation "rest[s] upon the Fifth Amendment," due at time of taking plus interest), and First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U.S. 304 (1987) ("government action that works a taking . . . necessarily implicates the ‘constitutional obligation to pay just compensation’"). Williamson County erroneously treated the Clause as creating only a right to state procedures rather than a direct constitutional violation, drawing flawed analogies from Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U.S. 986 (1984) (federal administrative exhaustion), the Tucker Act (28 U.S.C. §1491(a)(1), itself a Takings Clause remedy), and Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527 (1981) (due process, not takings). It created a "Catch-22" via San Remo Hotel’s preclusion of federal claims after state inverse condemnation proceedings. Historical practice and precedents like Cherokee Nation v. Southern Kansas R. Co., 135 U.S. 641 (1890), confirm violations occur at taking but equitable relief (e.g., injunctions) is unavailable if adequate post-deprivation compensation exists, as in nearly all states and under the Tucker Act.

Stare decisis factors—poor reasoning, unworkability (San Remo trap), inconsistency with related decisions, and lack of reliance interests—supported overruling Williamson County, whose rationale had been repeatedly recast. Governments face no new liability or injunction risk, as compensation remedies foreclose equitable relief. The judgment of the Third Circuit was vacated and remanded. Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion, joined by Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh; Justice Thomas concurred; Justice Kagan dissented, joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor.
