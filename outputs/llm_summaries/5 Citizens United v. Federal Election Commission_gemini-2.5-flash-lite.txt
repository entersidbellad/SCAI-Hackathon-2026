Here is a summary of the Supreme Court's decision in *Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission*:

### 1. Facts of the Case

Citizens United, a non-profit corporation, produced a film titled *Hillary: The Movie* that was critical of then-Senator Hillary Clinton, a candidate for the 2008 Presidential nomination. Citizens United intended to make the film available through video-on-demand within 30 days of primary elections and produced television advertisements to promote it.

Under Section 441b of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), corporations and unions are prohibited from using their general treasury funds for "independent expenditures" for speech that constitutes an "electioneering communication" or expressly advocates for the election or defeat of a candidate. An "electioneering communication" is defined as a broadcast, cable, or satellite communication that refers to a clearly identified candidate and is made within a specific timeframe before an election.

Citizens United sought declaratory and injunctive relief, arguing that Section 441b was unconstitutional as applied to their film and advertisements. They also challenged BCRA's disclaimer, disclosure, and reporting requirements as applied to their materials. The District Court denied Citizens United's request for an injunction and granted summary judgment to the Federal Election Commission (FEC). Citizens United appealed this decision to the Supreme Court.

### 2. Legal Question(s)

The Supreme Court addressed several legal questions, including:

*   Whether Section 441b of BCRA, which prohibits corporations and unions from using their general treasury funds for independent expenditures on electioneering communications or express advocacy, is constitutional.
*   Specifically, whether the prohibition on corporate independent expenditures violates the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech.
*   Whether the precedent set in *Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce* (1990), which allowed for restrictions on corporate political speech based on the speaker's corporate identity, should be upheld or overruled.
*   Whether BCRA's disclaimer, disclosure, and reporting requirements are constitutional as applied to Citizens United's film and advertisements.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding

The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, **overruled** *Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce* and held that Section 441b's restrictions on independent expenditures by corporations and unions are **unconstitutional**. The Court reasoned that the First Amendment protects political speech regardless of the speaker's corporate identity.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Corporate Speech is Protected Speech:** The Court reaffirmed that the First Amendment protects speech by corporations. It rejected the idea that the government can ban political speech based on the speaker's corporate identity.
*   **Rejection of the "Antidistortion" Rationale:** The Court overruled *Austin*'s "antidistortion" rationale, which argued that corporate wealth could distort the political marketplace. The Court found this rationale inconsistent with First Amendment principles, stating that the First Amendment protects speech, not the speaker's financial ability to speak. The Court also noted that this rationale could lead to banning political speech by media corporations, which are currently exempt from some restrictions but possess significant wealth.
*   **Rejection of the Anticorruption Rationale for Independent Expenditures:** The Court held that independent expenditures, unlike direct contributions to candidates, do not give rise to *quid pro quo* corruption or the appearance thereof. Therefore, the government's interest in preventing corruption is not a sufficient justification for banning corporate independent expenditures.
*   **Shareholder Protection Not a Basis for Banning Speech:** The Court found that the interest in protecting shareholders from being compelled to fund corporate political speech was not a sufficient basis to ban such speech, as shareholders have other avenues to voice their dissent and the statute was both underinclusive and overinclusive in addressing this concern.
*   **Disclaimer and Disclosure Requirements Upheld:** The Court affirmed the constitutionality of BCRA's disclaimer and disclosure requirements. It reasoned that these requirements do not prevent speech but rather provide information to the electorate about the sources of election-related spending, which is a sufficiently important governmental interest. The Court found that Citizens United had not demonstrated that these requirements would subject its donors to threats or reprisals.

**Precedent Set:**

The decision in *Citizens United* significantly altered campaign finance law by holding that the government cannot prohibit corporations and unions from making independent expenditures for political speech. This ruling effectively struck down key provisions of BCRA that restricted such spending and overturned the precedent established in *Austin*. The Court returned to the principle that the First Amendment protects political speech based on its content, not the identity of the speaker.
