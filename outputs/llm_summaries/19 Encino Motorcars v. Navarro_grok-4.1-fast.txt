### 1. Facts of the Case
Encino Motorcars, LLC, a Mercedes-Benz dealership in California (petitioner), employed Hector Navarro et al. (respondents), current and former service advisors. Service advisors interact with customers, sell them services for their vehicles, meet customers, listen to concerns, suggest repair and maintenance services, sell new accessories or replacement parts, record service orders, follow up as services are performed, and explain repair work upon vehicle return. In 2012, respondents sued petitioner in the District Court for backpay, alleging violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. §207(a), by failing to pay overtime, claiming they were not exempt under 29 U.S.C. §213(b)(10)(A). Petitioner moved to dismiss, arguing exemption. The District Court agreed and dismissed. The Ninth Circuit reversed, deferring under Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), to a 2011 Department of Labor (DOL) rule, 76 Fed. Reg. 18832 (codified at 29 CFR §779.372(c)), interpreting "salesman" to exclude service advisors; see Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 780 F.3d 1267 (2015). The Supreme Court vacated and remanded in Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro (Encino I), 579 U.S. ___ (2016), holding no deference due to the 2011 rule's procedural defect but not deciding exemption coverage. On remand, the Ninth Circuit again reversed, holding service advisors not exempt; 845 F.3d 925 (2017). The Supreme Court granted certiorari, 582 U.S. ___ (2017).

### 2. Legal Question(s)
Whether service advisors at car dealerships are exempt from the FLSA's overtime-pay requirement under 29 U.S.C. §213(b)(10)(A), which exempts "any salesman, partsman, or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or servicing automobiles, trucks, or farm implements, if he is employed by a nonmanufacturing establishment primarily engaged in the business of selling such vehicles or implements to ultimate purchasers." The parties agreed petitioner qualified as such an establishment, respondents were not partsmen or mechanics, and respondents were not primarily engaged in selling automobiles.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit and held that service advisors are exempt under §213(b)(10)(A) as "salesm[e]n . . . primarily engaged in . . . servicing automobiles." Justice Thomas delivered the opinion for the Court, joined by Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Kennedy, Justice Alito, and Justice Gorsuch; Justice Ginsburg dissented, joined by Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan.

Reasoning: (a) "Salesman" has its ordinary meaning as someone who sells goods or services (14 Oxford English Dictionary 391 (2d ed. 1989); Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1262 (1966)), and service advisors sell customers services for their vehicles. (b) Service advisors are "primarily engaged in . . . servicing automobiles," as "servicing" means "the action of maintaining or repairing a motor vehicle" or "the action of providing a service" (15 Oxford English Dictionary 39); they are integral to the process, like partsmen (who do not physically repair vehicles but obtain and provide parts; 1 Dept. of Labor, Dictionary of Occupational Titles 33 (3d ed. 1965)). (c) The Ninth Circuit's distributive canon (matching "salesman" with "selling" and "partsman/mechanic" with "servicing") fails because "or" connecting nouns and gerunds is disjunctive (United States v. Woods, 571 U.S. 31, 45 (2013)); context favors this: no one-to-one matching of three nouns with two gerunds; disjunctive reading linguistically possible and apt for service advisors; exemption's breadth ("any," three "or"s) supports any combination (Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.S. 214, 219 (2008); Brown v. Gardner, 513 U.S. 115, 118 (1994)). (d) FLSA exemptions receive a fair reading, not narrow construction, absent textual indication otherwise. (e) DOL's 1966–1967 Occupational Outlook Handbook and FLSA legislative history (silence on service advisors) are unpersuasive; text controls (Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 495, n.13 (1985)).

Precedent set: Service advisors are exempt from FLSA overtime; exemptions interpreted by fair reading of text, not narrow construction; no deference to procedurally defective agency rules (Encino I); reversed and remanded, 584 U.S. ___ (2018).
