### Summary of Supreme Court Opinion in Van Buren v. United States

#### 1. Facts of the Case
Nathan Van Buren, a former Georgia police sergeant, used his patrol-car computer to access a law enforcement database to retrieve information about a particular license plate number in exchange for money. Although Van Buren had valid credentials to access the database, his actions violated department policy against obtaining database information for non-law-enforcement purposes. The access was part of an FBI sting operation. Van Buren was charged and convicted under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) for "exceeding authorized access" by accessing the database for an improper purpose.

#### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Supreme Court addressed the specific legal question of whether Van Buren "exceeded authorized access" under the CFAA by accessing a computer with authorization but using that access to obtain information for an improper purpose. The CFAA defines "exceeds authorized access" as accessing a computer "with authorization and to use such access to obtain or alter information in the computer that the accesser is not entitled so to obtain or alter." The key issue was the interpretation of "entitled so to obtain," particularly the meaning of "so" and its implications for determining when someone exceeds authorized access.

#### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Supreme Court held that Van Buren did not "exceed authorized access" under the CFAA. The Court interpreted "exceeds authorized access" to mean accessing a computer with authorization but then obtaining information located in particular areas of the computer to which the accesser lacks access privileges. The Court ruled that the phrase "is not entitled so to obtain" refers to information that a person is not allowed to obtain by using a computer they are authorized to access. The Court's reasoning was based on the plain meaning of the statute, the structure of the CFAA, and the implications of different interpretations on common computer activities. The Court reversed the Eleventh Circuit's judgment and remanded the case.

The Court's decision was based on a detailed analysis of the statutory text, particularly the meaning of "so" in the context of "entitled so to obtain." The majority rejected the Government's broader interpretation that would have criminalized a wide range of commonplace computer activities, emphasizing that their interpretation aligns with the specialized meaning of "access" in the computing context and the statutory structure. The dissent, however, argued that the majority's interpretation contradicts basic principles of property law and the ordinary meaning of "exceeds authorized access."
