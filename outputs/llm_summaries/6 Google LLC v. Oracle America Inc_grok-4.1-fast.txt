### 1. Facts of the Case
Oracle America, Inc., the owner of a copyright in Java SE—a computer platform using the Java programming language—sued Google LLC in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in 2010, alleging copyright infringement. In 2005, Google acquired Android, Inc., and sought to develop an open software platform for mobile devices like smartphones. To attract the approximately six million programmers familiar with Java, Google copied roughly 11,500 lines of declaring code from the Java SE Application Programming Interface (API)—specifically, the declaring code and structure, sequence, and organization (SSO) for 37 packages—without permission, while writing its own implementing code (millions of lines) tailored for smartphones. This copying enabled Java programmers to use familiar method calls (e.g., "java.lang.Math.max(4, 6)") to invoke tasks on Android. Negotiations for a license between Google and Sun Microsystems (Oracle's predecessor) broke down due to disagreements over interoperability and openness.

Litigation proceeded in phases: A jury rejected Oracle's patent claims, found limited copyright infringement, but deadlocked on fair use; the District Court ruled the API declaring code not copyrightable under 17 U.S.C. §102(b) as a "system or method of operation" (Oracle America, Inc. v. Google Inc., 872 F. Supp. 2d 974 (ND Cal. 2012)). The Federal Circuit reversed, holding the declaring code and SSO copyrightable (Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc., 750 F. 3d 1339 (CA Fed. 2014)). The Supreme Court denied certiorari (Google, Inc. v. Oracle America, Inc., 576 U. S. 1071 (2015)). On remand, a jury found Google's use a fair use. The Federal Circuit reversed again, holding no fair use as a matter of law (886 F. 3d 1179 (CA Fed. 2018)), and remanded for damages. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on both copyrightability and fair use.

### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Court addressed: (1) whether the 11,500 lines of Java SE API declaring code and SSO for 37 packages are copyrightable, particularly in light of 17 U.S.C. §102(b) excluding "any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery"; and (2) if copyrightable, whether Google's copying constituted "fair use" under 17 U.S.C. §107, which provides limitations on exclusive rights and directs consideration of four factors: (1) purpose and character of the use; (2) nature of the copyrighted work; (3) amount and substantiality of the portion used; and (4) effect upon the potential market or value. To decide no more than necessary, the Court assumed arguendo that the API was copyrightable and focused solely on fair use. The Court also held that fair use is a mixed question of law and fact, with underlying facts reviewed for substantial evidence but the ultimate legal question reviewed de novo, consistent with the Seventh Amendment.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Court held, 6-2, that Google's copying of the Java SE API declaring code was a fair use as a matter of law, reversing the Federal Circuit (886 F. 3d 1179) and remanding. Justice Breyer delivered the opinion, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh; Justice Barrett took no part; Justice Thomas dissented, joined by Justice Alito.

**Reasoning**: Fair use under §107 is a flexible, equitable doctrine accounting for technological changes and the functional nature of computer programs, serving as a context-based check on copyright monopolies to promote progress under Art. I, §8, cl. 8. All four factors favored fair use:

- **Nature of the work (§107(2))**: Favors fair use; the API declaring code is a user interface (not core creative expression like implementing code), inherently bound with uncopyrightable ideas (task organization), method calls, and programmer investment, unlike typical programs.
- **Purpose/character (§107(1))**: Favors fair use; transformative as Google reimplemented the interface only as needed for a new smartphone platform/environment, enabling programmers' skills in Android (a distinct, open system), furthering innovation (e.g., industry reimplementations like Sun's own); commerciality not dispositive.
- **Amount/substantiality (§107(3))**: Favors fair use; 11,500 lines (0.4% of 2.86 million total API lines) were quantitatively small relative to the whole and qualitatively tethered to the transformative purpose (compatibility for programmers), not copied for creativity.
- **Market effects (§107(4))**: Favors fair use; Android not a substitute for Java SE (desktop/laptop focus; Sun/Oracle failed in smartphones); Oracle benefited from Java ecosystem expansion; enforcement risks public harm by locking innovation (programmer lock-in).

The holding applies fair use precedents (e.g., Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U. S. 569 (1994); Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U. S. 539 (1985); Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U. S. 417 (1984)) to functional computer interfaces without overruling them, recognizing Congress's 1980 extension of copyright to programs (§101) and intent for case-by-case fair use application.
