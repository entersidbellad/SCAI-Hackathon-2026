### 1. Facts of the Case
Current and former student-athletes in men’s Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) football and men’s and women’s Division I basketball, including named plaintiff Shawne Alston, filed a class-action antitrust lawsuit against the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and 11 Division I conferences (collectively, the NCAA), consolidated with American Athletic Conference et al. v. Alston et al., Nos. 20-512 and 20-520. The plaintiffs challenged the NCAA’s rules limiting compensation and benefits for student-athletes as violations of §1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §1. Key undisputed facts included: the NCAA and its members agreed to compensation limits; the NCAA enforced these limits on member schools; and the limits affected interstate commerce and depressed student-athlete compensation below competitive market levels. After years of pretrial proceedings and a 10-day bench trial in In re National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Athletic Grant-in-Aid Cap Antitrust Litig., 375 F. Supp. 3d 1058 (ND Cal. 2019), the district court upheld NCAA rules limiting undergraduate athletic scholarships and compensation unrelated to education but enjoined rules capping education-related benefits, such as graduate or vocational school scholarships, academic tutoring payments, and post-eligibility internships. The injunction took effect in August 2020, applied only to NCAA and multi-conference agreements (leaving individual conferences free to impose restrictions), and allowed the NCAA to define education-related benefits and regulate their provision. Both sides appealed. The Ninth Circuit affirmed in full, holding the district court “struck the right balance,” 958 F. 3d 1239, 1263 (2020). The NCAA petitioned for certiorari, seeking reversal of the injunction; the student-athletes did not challenge the upheld rules. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the enjoined restrictions on the premise of the NCAA’s monopsony power in the market for student-athlete labor in Division I basketball and FBS football.

### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Court addressed whether the NCAA’s restrictions on student-athlete compensation—specifically, the subset limiting education-related benefits—are subject to ordinary rule of reason analysis under the Sherman Act or entitled to more deferential review (e.g., quick-look or abbreviated scrutiny) as a joint venture preserving amateurism; whether National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla., 468 U. S. 85 (1984), approved the NCAA’s compensation limits; whether the NCAA merits a Sherman Act exemption as a noncommercial entity advancing undergraduate education; and whether the district court’s application of the rule of reason—requiring proof of anticompetitive effects, procompetitive justifications, and substantially less restrictive alternatives—and its injunction were lawful, including claims of imposing a least-restrictive-means test, redefining amateurism, and micromanaging the NCAA.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Court unanimously affirmed the Ninth Circuit, holding the district court’s injunction consistent with established antitrust principles. Justice Gorsuch delivered the opinion. The NCAA’s compensation restrictions are subject to ordinary rule of reason analysis—a fact-specific assessment of market power and actual effects on competition—rather than quick-look approval, as the NCAA exercises monopsony power in the labor market for Division I basketball and FBS football student-athletes, suppressing wages and labor quantity below competitive levels. Board of Regents did not analyze or approve compensation limits (focusing instead on television restraints) and its comments on amateurism were non-binding dicta in a changed market. The NCAA receives no antitrust exemption for pursuing noncommercial educational objectives, as the Sherman Act applies regardless and exemptions are for Congress. The district court correctly applied the rule of reason: plaintiffs proved substantial anticompetitive effects (undisputed); the NCAA’s procompetitive justification (preserving consumer demand for amateur college sports distinct from professional sports) succeeded only for non-education-related limits; and plaintiffs showed substantially less restrictive alternatives for education-related benefits, which “emphasize that the recipients are students” without blurring the college-professional distinction or impairing demand. The injunction was narrowly tailored, preserving NCAA leeway to define and regulate education-related benefits, cap academic awards (not below athletic awards of $5,980 annually), police unrelated compensation, and allowing conferences stricter rules; it avoids least-restrictive-means scrutiny or micromanagement. Precedent: NCAA compensation rules receive no special deference and must withstand rule of reason scrutiny; courts must avoid rote frameworks but assess restraints’ effects, justifications, and alternatives cautiously, mindful of judicial limits in dynamic markets. Justice Kavanaugh concurred, noting the decision requires ordinary rule of reason scrutiny for remaining NCAA compensation rules and questioning their procompetitive justification.
