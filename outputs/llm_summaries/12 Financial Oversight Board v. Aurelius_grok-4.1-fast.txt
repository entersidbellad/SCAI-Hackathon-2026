### 1. Facts of the Case
Puerto Rico faced a fiscal crisis, with public debt rising from $39.2 billion in 2005 to $71 billion in 2016, exacerbated by the expiration of tax advantages in 2006, industry exodus, emigration, and inability to restructure debt under federal bankruptcy law or local statutes invalidated in *Puerto Rico v. Franklin Cal. Tax-Free Trust*, 579 U. S. ___ (2016). In response, Congress enacted the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), 130 Stat. 549, 48 U. S. C. §2101 et seq., pursuant to Article IV, §3, cl. 2, creating the Financial Oversight and Management Board (Board) with seven voting members appointed by the President from lists provided by congressional leaders, without Senate confirmation (§101(e), 130 Stat. 554–555). The Governor serves ex officio without vote (§101(b)(e)). On August 31, 2016, President Obama appointed the members, who filed Title III bankruptcy petitions under PROMESA §§301–302, 130 Stat. 577, 579, on behalf of the Commonwealth and five entities: Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation (COFINA), Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority, Employees Retirement System, Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, and Puerto Rico Public Buildings Authority (consolidated in *In re Financial Oversight and Management Bd. of Puerto Rico*, No. 17–BK–3283 (PR)). After proceedings, creditors including Aurelius Investment, LLC, et al., moved to dismiss, arguing the appointments violated the Appointments Clause, Art. II, §2, cl. 2. The District Court denied the motions (*In re Financial Oversight and Management Bd. of Puerto Rico*, 318 F. Supp. 3d 537 (PR 2018)). The First Circuit reversed, holding the appointments unconstitutional but prior actions valid under the de facto officer doctrine (915 F. 3d 838 (2019)). The Board, United States, Aurelius Investment, LLC, et al., Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of All Title III Debtors Other Than COFINA, and Unión de Trabajadores de la Industria Eléctrica y Riego, Inc. petitioned for certiorari (Nos. 18–1334, 18–1475, 18–1496, 18–1514, 18–1521), which the Supreme Court granted and consolidated (588 U. S. ___ (2019)).

### 2. Legal Question(s)
Whether the President's appointment of the seven voting members of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico, without Senate advice and consent as required by the Appointments Clause (Art. II, §2, cl. 2), is constitutional, given PROMESA's creation of the Board pursuant to Congress's Article IV, §3, cl. 2 power and its designation of the Board as "an entity within the territorial government" not a federal department, agency, establishment, or instrumentality (§101(c), 130 Stat. 553).

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Supreme Court reversed the First Circuit (915 F. 3d 838) and remanded. Justice Breyer, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Ginsburg, Alito, Kagan, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh, held that the Appointments Clause applies to all "Officers of the United States," including those exercising power in or related to Puerto Rico, based on the Clause's text, structural allocation of appointment power between President and Senate to ensure accountability, historical practice (e.g., Senate confirmation for territorial Governors with federal duties like those under Acts of Aug. 7, 1789, 1 Stat. 50; June 6, 1900, 31 Stat. 325), and absence of Article IV exception. However, the Clause does not restrict appointment of local officers with primarily local duties created under Article I, §8, cl. 17 or Article IV, §3, cl. 2, as confirmed by text distinguishing federal from nonfederal officers, longstanding practice of filling such offices by election or local appointment (e.g., Northwest Territory under Act of Aug. 7, 1789; Puerto Rico under Foraker Act of 1900, 31 Stat. 77; Jones Act of 1917, 39 Stat. 951; Public Law 600, 64 Stat. 319), and precedents like *O’Donoghue v. United States*, 289 U. S. 516 (1933), and *Palmore v. United States*, 411 U. S. 389 (1973). PROMESA Board members exercise primarily local duties: investigatory powers backed by Puerto Rican law (§104, 130 Stat. 558–561); oversight of fiscal plans, budgets, laws, and debt issuance for Puerto Rico (§§201–207, id., at 563–575); representation of Puerto Rico in Title III bankruptcy (§§304, 315, id., at 579, 584); funded by Puerto Rico (§107, id., at 562). Cases like *Buckley v. Valeo*, 424 U. S. 1 (1976); *Freytag v. Commissioner*, 501 U. S. 868 (1991); and *Lucia v. SEC*, 585 U. S. ___ (2018), do not govern, as they involved indisputably federal duties. Justices Thomas and Sotomayor filed opinions concurring in the judgment. Precedent: Appointments Clause requires Senate confirmation for federal officers but not for local officers with primarily local duties in Territories or D.C., even if created by federal law under Article IV or Article I, §8, cl. 17. Court declined to address de facto officer doctrine (*Ryder v. United States*, 515 U. S. 177 (1995)), Insular Cases (e.g., *Downes v. Bidwell*, 182 U. S. 244 (1901)), Federal Relations Act, or Public Law 600.
