### 1. Facts of the Case
Wisconsin elects members of its State Legislature from single-member districts, with the legislature required by the Wisconsin Constitution to redraw district boundaries following each census. After the 2010 census, a Republican-controlled legislature passed, and a Republican governor signed, a new districting plan known as Act 43 (Wis. Stat. §§ 4.009, 4.01–4.99; 2011 Wis. Laws ch. 4). Under Act 43, Republicans won majorities in the State Assembly in the 2012 election (60 seats with 48.6% of the two-party statewide vote) and the 2014 election (63 seats with 52% of the statewide vote).

In July 2015, twelve Democratic voters, including lead plaintiff William Whitford (a resident of heavily Democratic Assembly District 76), filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin against several members of the state election commission (appellants Beverly R. Gill et al.). The plaintiffs (appellees William Whitford et al.) alleged that Act 43 constituted an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander that harmed the Democratic Party's ability to translate votes into legislative seats through "cracking" (dividing Democratic voters among districts where they fail to achieve majorities) and "packing" (concentrating Democratic voters into a few districts won by large margins). They claimed this violated their First Amendment right of association and Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection, as measured by an "efficiency gap" metric comparing each party's "wasted votes" (votes for losing candidates or excess votes for winning candidates beyond what is needed to win) across all districts. Four plaintiffs—Mary Lynne Donohue (District 26), Wendy Sue Johnson, Janet Mitchell, and Jerome Wallace—specifically alleged packing or cracking in their own districts.

The defendants moved to dismiss for lack of standing, arguing that individual voters' interests are limited to their own districts. A three-judge District Court denied the motion (Whitford v. Nichol, 151 F. Supp. 3d 918 (WD Wis. 2015)), held a trial, and ruled Act 43 unconstitutional under a three-part test: (1) intent to impede effectiveness of votes based on political affiliation; (2) that effect; and (3) no legitimate justification (218 F. Supp. 3d 837 (WD Wis. 2016)). The court found a cognizable statewide equal protection injury to Democratic voters, enjoined Act 43's use, and ordered a remedial plan by November 1, 2017. The defendants appealed directly to the Supreme Court under 28 U.S.C. §1253, which stayed the judgment (582 U.S. ___ (2017)).

### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Court addressed whether the plaintiffs demonstrated Article III standing to challenge the statewide constitutionality of Act 43, specifically whether they showed a particularized "injury in fact"—an invasion of a legally protected interest that is concrete and particularized, affecting them in a personal and individual way (Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560, and n. 1 (1992))—arising from alleged vote dilution via partisan gerrymandering. The Court considered whether the alleged statewide harm to Democrats (measured by efficiency gap and partisan asymmetry) or to collective representation constituted such an injury, or whether any injury was district-specific, and distinguished prior cases on malapportionment (Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962); Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964)) and racial gerrymandering (United States v. Hays, 515 U.S. 737 (1995); Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, 575 U.S. ___ (2015)). The Court did not reach the justiciability of partisan gerrymandering claims or the merits.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Supreme Court held unanimously that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate Article III standing and vacated the District Court's judgment (218 F. Supp. 3d 837), remanding for further proceedings rather than directing dismissal, given the unsettled nature of partisan gerrymandering claims.

Chief Justice Roberts's opinion (joined by Kennedy, Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito, Sotomayor, and Kagan JJ.; Thomas and Gorsuch JJ. joined except Part III) reasoned that partisan gerrymandering injury, if any, from vote dilution is district-specific because a voter resides in and votes in only one district, where boundaries and voter composition determine packing or cracking; a voter outside a gerrymandered district asserts only a generalized grievance (Hays, 515 U.S. at 745). Statewide claims analogized to malapportionment cases (Baker; Reynolds) fail because those injuries were individual (unequal vote weight), remedied district-by-district, not statewide group harm to party fortunes or legislative composition, which is a nonjusticiable generalized grievance (Lance v. Coffman, 549 U.S. 437 (2007); Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 357 (1996)). Four plaintiffs alleged but did not prove district-specific harm at trial; evidence offered—Whitford's testimony on desiring a Democratic majority; mapmakers' partisan deliberations (e.g., "S curves"); and efficiency gap/partisan asymmetry studies—measured group/party effects, not individual vote burdens, and thus insufficient for standing (Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 560).

The Court set no binding precedent on justiciability or merits of partisan gerrymandering but reaffirmed that standing requires proof of concrete, particularized, district-specific injury for vote dilution claims (distinguishing Gaffney v. Cummings, 412 U.S. 735 (1973); Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U.S. 109 (1986); Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U.S. 267 (2004); League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399 (2006)); remedies must be tailored to proven injury; and left open other theories (e.g., associational harm). Justice Kagan (joined by Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor JJ.) concurred, elaborating standing proof for vote dilution (e.g., alternative maps) and associational claims. Justice Thomas (joined by Gorsuch J.) concurred in part, advocating remand with dismissal instructions.
