### 1. Facts of the Case
The cases before the Supreme Court were *Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis* (No. 16–285, on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, 823 F. 3d 1147), *Ernst & Young LLP et al. v. Morris et al.* (No. 16–300, on certiorari to the Ninth Circuit, 834 F. 3d 975), and *National Labor Relations Board v. Murphy Oil USA, Inc., et al.* (No. 16–307, on certiorari to the Fifth Circuit, 808 F. 3d 1013). In each, an employer (Epic Systems Corporation, Ernst & Young LLP, and Murphy Oil USA, Inc.) and employee (Jacob Lewis, Stephen Morris et al., and employees involved in the NLRB proceeding) entered into an agreement providing for individualized arbitration proceedings to resolve employment disputes. Employees nonetheless filed Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U. S. C. §216(b), and related state-law claims in federal court, seeking class or collective actions (e.g., Morris alleged misclassification of junior accountants as professionals without overtime pay). Employers moved to compel individualized arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U. S. C. §§2, 3, 4. District courts generally granted the motions, but the Seventh and Ninth Circuits reversed, holding the agreements violated the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 U. S. C. §157, by interfering with protected "concerted activities"; the Fifth Circuit affirmed enforcement against the NLRB. The cases reached the Supreme Court to resolve a circuit split arising after the NLRB's 2012 decision in *D. R. Horton, Inc.*, 357 N. L. R. B. 2277, which held such agreements unlawful (contrary to prior NLRB General Counsel guidance in 2010 and earlier courts), with some circuits deferring under *Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.*, 467 U. S. 837.

### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Court addressed whether the FAA requires courts to enforce, as written, arbitration agreements mandating individualized proceedings for employment disputes, or whether the FAA's saving clause (9 U. S. C. §2, allowing revocation on grounds "at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract") excuses enforcement where such agreements allegedly violate the NLRA by interfering with employees' §7 right "to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection," 29 U. S. C. §157. Employees argued the agreements were unlawful under the NLRA, rendering them revocable under the FAA saving clause; employers contended the FAA protects such agreements from interference, with no NLRA conflict.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Court ruled 5-4 that Congress instructed in the FAA that arbitration agreements providing for individualized proceedings must be enforced as written, and neither the FAA saving clause nor the NLRA suggests otherwise (Gorsuch, J., for the majority, joined by Roberts, C. J., and Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito, JJ.; Thomas, J., concurring; Ginsburg, J., dissenting, joined by Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ.). The Court reversed the Seventh and Ninth Circuits (Nos. 16–285 and 16–300) and affirmed the Fifth Circuit (No. 16–307). Reasoning: (1) FAA §§2, 3, 4 establish a "liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements" and require "rigorous" enforcement of parties' chosen procedures, including individualized arbitration (*AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion*, 563 U. S. 333; *American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant*, 570 U. S. 228); (2) the saving clause applies only to "generally applicable contract defenses, such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability," not those targeting arbitration's "fundamental attributes" like bilaterality (*Concepcion*, 563 U. S. at 339, 344), as employees' NLRA challenge does by objecting solely to individualized proceedings; (3) the NLRA does not override the FAA, as there is no "clear and manifest" congressional intent to displace it (*Morton v. Mancari*, 417 U. S. 535, 551; *United States v. Fausto*, 484 U. S. 439, 452–453)—§7 focuses on union organization and collective bargaining, not class/collective procedures (unknown in 1935), per text (*ejusdem generis*), structure (no rules for class certification, opt-out, etc.), and context (FLSA permits but does not mandate collective actions over arbitration, *Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp.*, 500 U. S. 20, 32); Congress knows how to override the FAA expressly (e.g., 15 U. S. C. §1226(a)(2)); no Chevron deference due, as NLRB interprets FAA (not its statute) amid Executive disagreement. Precedent set: Employer-employee arbitration agreements requiring individualized proceedings are enforceable under the FAA; NLRA §7 protects workplace concerted activities akin to unionization/collective bargaining but not a right to class or collective actions in court or arbitration, harmonizing the statutes without implied repeal.
