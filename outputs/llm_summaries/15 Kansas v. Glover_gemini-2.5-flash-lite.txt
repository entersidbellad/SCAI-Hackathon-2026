Here is a summary of the Supreme Court's opinion in *Kansas v. Glover*:

### 1. Facts of the Case

On April 28, 2016, Deputy Mark Mehrer of the Douglas County, Kansas Sheriff's Office was on routine patrol when he observed a 1995 Chevrolet 1500 pickup truck with Kansas license plate 295ATJ. Deputy Mehrer ran a check on the license plate through the Kansas Department of Revenue's file service. The check revealed that the truck was registered to Charles Glover Jr. and that Mr. Glover's driver's license had been revoked in Kansas. Deputy Mehrer assumed that the registered owner, Charles Glover Jr., was the driver of the truck. He did not observe any traffic infractions and did not attempt to identify the driver. Based solely on the information that the registered owner had a revoked license, Deputy Mehrer initiated a traffic stop. The driver of the truck was indeed Charles Glover Jr., who was subsequently charged with driving as a habitual violator. Glover moved to suppress all evidence from the stop, arguing that Deputy Mehrer lacked reasonable suspicion. The District Court granted the motion. The Kansas Court of Appeals reversed, finding the deputy's inference reasonable. However, the Kansas Supreme Court reversed again, holding that the stop violated the Fourth Amendment because the deputy lacked reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Kansas petitioned for a writ of certiorari, which the Supreme Court granted.

### 2. Legal Question(s)

The central legal question before the Supreme Court was: Whether an investigative traffic stop initiated by a police officer, after running a vehicle's license plate and learning that the registered owner's driver's license has been revoked, is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment when the officer lacks information negating the inference that the owner is the driver.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding

The Supreme Court held that when an officer lacks information that negates the inference that the registered owner of a vehicle is the driver, an investigative traffic stop made after learning that the registered owner's driver's license has been revoked is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.

The Court reasoned that an officer may initiate a brief investigative traffic stop if they have a "particularized and objective basis" to suspect legal wrongdoing. This standard requires less suspicion than probable cause and relies on the "factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act." The Court found that Deputy Mehrer's commonsense inference that the owner of the truck was likely the driver provided more than reasonable suspicion. This inference is not rendered unreasonable simply because the driver is not always the owner or because Glover's license was revoked. The Court noted that empirical studies and common experience indicate that drivers with revoked licenses frequently continue to drive. Furthermore, Kansas's license revocation scheme, which targets drivers who have demonstrated disregard for the law or are deemed unfit to drive, reinforces the reasonableness of inferring that such an individual might continue to drive.

The Court rejected Glover's arguments that the inference was unreasonable because it was not based on law enforcement training or experience, stating that such a requirement is inconsistent with Fourth Amendment jurisprudence and would unduly burden officers. The Court also dismissed the argument that this approach allows officers to rely exclusively on probabilities, explaining that officers, like jurors, may rely on probabilities, and in this case, the deputy combined database information with commonsense judgments to form reasonable suspicion of specific criminal activity by a specific individual.

The Court emphasized the narrow scope of its holding, reiterating that the reasonable suspicion standard considers the totality of the circumstances. While additional facts could dispel reasonable suspicion, Deputy Mehrer possessed no exculpatory information to rebut the reasonable inference that Glover was driving his own truck. The judgment of the Kansas Supreme Court was reversed, and the case was remanded.
