### Summary of Gill v. Whitford (2018)

#### 1. Facts of the Case
The case involves a challenge to Wisconsin's 2011 state legislative redistricting plan, known as Act 43, which was enacted by a Republican-controlled legislature and signed into law by a Republican governor. Twelve Democratic voters alleged that Act 43 was a partisan gerrymander designed to disadvantage Democratic voters by "cracking" and "packing" them into districts. The plaintiffs claimed that this gerrymandering violated their First Amendment right of association and their Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection. The case was heard by a three-judge District Court, which ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, finding Act 43 unconstitutional. The defendants, members of the state election commission, appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

#### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Supreme Court addressed the question of whether the plaintiffs had standing to challenge Act 43. Specifically, the Court considered whether the plaintiffs had suffered a particularized injury due to the alleged partisan gerrymandering and whether their claimed harm was sufficiently concrete and individualized to satisfy Article III standing requirements.

#### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate Article III standing because they did not prove that they suffered a particularized injury. The Court ruled that to establish standing in a partisan gerrymandering case based on vote dilution, a plaintiff must show that their individual vote was diluted due to being "cracked" or "packed" in their specific district. The Court found that while four plaintiffs alleged such particularized burdens in their complaint, they failed to pursue these allegations at trial and instead relied on a theory of statewide injury. The Court vacated the District Court's judgment and remanded the case, giving the plaintiffs an opportunity to prove concrete and particularized injuries. The Court's decision emphasizes that a plaintiff's remedy must be tailored to redress their particular injury, and it leaves open the possibility of considering other theories of harm and justiciability in future cases.
