Here is a summary of the Supreme Court opinion in *Brown v. Board of Education*:

**1. Facts of the Case**

This case consolidated four separate lawsuits from Kansas, South Carolina, Virginia, and Delaware. In each instance, minor plaintiffs of the Negro race, through their legal representatives, sought admission to public schools on a nonsegregated basis. They alleged that state laws requiring or permitting racial segregation in public schools denied them the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. In three of the cases (Kansas, South Carolina, and Virginia), three-judge federal district courts denied relief, relying on the "separate but equal" doctrine established in *Plessy v. Ferguson*, 163 U. S. 537, even though some found the facilities for Negro children to be inferior and ordered equalization. In the Delaware case, the Delaware Court of Chancery ordered the admission of Negro children to white schools due to the inferiority of the Negro schools, a decision affirmed by the Delaware Supreme Court. The Supreme Court of Delaware, however, indicated that a modification of the decree might be possible after equalization of the Negro and white schools. The cases reached the Supreme Court due to the significant constitutional question presented regarding the legality of state-mandated segregation in public education.

**2. Legal Question(s)**

The central legal question before the Supreme Court was whether segregation of children in public schools solely on the basis of race, even if the physical facilities and other tangible factors are equal, deprives children of the minority group of equal educational opportunities and thus violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court also considered the historical context of the Fourteenth Amendment and its intended application to public education, as well as the continued validity of the "separate but equal" doctrine in the context of public schooling.

**3. Conclusion/Holding**

The Supreme Court unanimously held that segregation of children in public schools solely on the basis of race is unconstitutional and violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court reasoned that while the history of the Fourteenth Amendment is inconclusive regarding its specific application to public education, the issue must be decided in light of the present-day importance of public education in American society. The Court found that education is a fundamental right that must be available to all on equal terms. It concluded that segregation, even with equal tangible facilities, generates a feeling of inferiority in minority children, thereby depriving them of equal educational opportunities. The Court explicitly rejected the "separate but equal" doctrine as having no place in the field of public education, stating that "separate educational facilities are inherently unequal." The Court then restored the cases to the docket for further argument on the specific forms of decrees to be implemented, acknowledging the complexity of desegregating public school systems.
