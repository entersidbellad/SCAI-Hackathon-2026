### 1. Facts of the Case
Kansas charged respondent Charles Glover, Jr., with driving as a habitual violator under Kan. Stat. Ann. §8–285(a)(3) following a traffic stop. On April 28, 2016, Deputy Mark Mehrer, a certified law enforcement officer with the Douglas County Kansas Sheriff’s Office, observed a 1995 Chevrolet 1500 pickup truck with Kansas plate 295ATJ while on routine patrol in Douglas County. Deputy Mehrer ran the plate through the Kansas Department of Revenue’s file service, confirming the truck was registered to Charles Glover Jr. and that Glover’s driver’s license had been revoked in Kansas. Deputy Mehrer assumed the registered owner was driving, observed no traffic infractions, did not attempt to identify the driver, and initiated the stop solely based on the revoked license information. Glover was identified as the driver. Glover moved to suppress all evidence from the stop, claiming lack of reasonable suspicion. The District Court granted the motion. The Kansas Court of Appeals reversed, holding the inference reasonable (54 Kan. App. 2d 377, 385, 400 P. 3d 182, 188 (2017)). The Kansas Supreme Court reversed, holding the stop violated the Fourth Amendment as the inference was merely a hunch without reasonable suspicion of criminal activity (308 Kan. 590, 591, 422 P. 3d 64, 66 (2018)). Kansas petitioned for certiorari (No. 18–556), which the Supreme Court granted (587 U. S. ___ (2019)).

### 2. Legal Question(s)
Whether a police officer violates the Fourth Amendment by initiating a brief investigative traffic stop after running a vehicle’s license plate, learning that the registered owner’s driver’s license has been revoked, and lacking information negating an inference that the owner is driving the vehicle. The Court addressed whether this scenario provides reasonable suspicion under the Fourth Amendment, which permits stops based on a “particularized and objective basis” for suspecting criminal activity (United States v. Cortez, 449 U. S. 411, 417 (1981); Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 21–22 (1968)), a standard less demanding than probable cause and allowing commonsense judgments and inferences about human behavior (Prado Navarette v. California, 572 U. S. 393, 397, 402 (2014); Illinois v. Wardlow, 528 U. S. 119, 125 (2000)).

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Supreme Court reversed the Kansas Supreme Court (589 U. S. ____ (2020)) in a 8-1 decision delivered by Justice Thomas, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito, Kagan, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh. Justice Kagan filed a concurring opinion joined by Justice Ginsburg; Justice Sotomayor dissented. The Court held that, absent information negating the inference, an investigative traffic stop is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment when an officer runs a license plate, learns the registered owner’s driver’s license is revoked, and infers the owner is driving. Reasoning: The deputy’s commonsense inference from three facts—observation of the truck matching the registered vehicle, plate linked to Glover, and Glover’s revoked license—provided reasonable suspicion, as the standard accounts for factual and practical considerations of everyday life and permits probabilities (Navarette, 572 U. S. at 402; United States v. Sokolow, 490 U. S. 1, 8–9 (1989)). The inference is not unreasonable merely because drivers are not always owners or because revoked drivers sometimes continue driving, as supported by empirical studies (e.g., 75% of suspended/revoked drivers continue driving; 19% of 2008–2012 fatal crash drivers had invalid licenses) and Kansas’s revocation scheme targeting those disregarding law or unfit to drive (Kan. Stat. Ann. §§8–254(a), 8–252, 8–255(a), 8–245(c), 21–6609(c), 8–286, 8–285). Rejected counterarguments: No requirement for law enforcement training/experience (Navarette, 572 U. S. at 402; Wardlow, 528 U. S. at 124; Sokolow, 490 U. S. at 8–9); officers may rely on probabilities, and here facts particularized suspicion to Glover driving with revoked license. Narrow holding: Totality of circumstances governs (Navarette, 572 U. S. at 397); additional facts (e.g., visible mismatch in driver’s age/gender to owner) could dispel suspicion, but none rebutted here. The case was remanded for further proceedings.
