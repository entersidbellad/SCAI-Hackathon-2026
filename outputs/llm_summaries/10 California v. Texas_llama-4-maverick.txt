### 1. Facts of the Case

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), enacted in 2010, originally required most Americans to obtain minimum essential health insurance coverage and imposed a monetary penalty on those who failed to comply. In 2017, Congress amended the Act by effectively nullifying the penalty by setting its amount to $0. Texas, along with 17 other states and two individuals (Neill Hurley and John Nantz), brought suit against federal officials, claiming that without the penalty, the ACA's minimum essential coverage provision (26 U.S.C. §5000A(a)) is unconstitutional. They sought a declaration that §5000A(a) is unconstitutional, a finding that the rest of the ACA is not severable from §5000A(a), and an injunction against enforcement of the rest of the ACA. California and other states intervened to defend the ACA's constitutionality.

### 2. Legal Question(s)

The Court addressed the specific constitutional or legal question of whether the plaintiffs have standing to challenge the constitutionality of 26 U.S.C. §5000A(a), the minimum essential coverage provision of the ACA, after the penalty for noncompliance was set to $0 in 2017. The Court considered whether the individual and state plaintiffs have alleged a personal injury fairly traceable to the defendants' allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding

The Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of §5000A(a) because they have not shown a past or future injury fairly traceable to the defendants' conduct enforcing the specific statutory provision they attack as unconstitutional. The Court reasoned that, without a penalty, §5000A(a) is unenforceable, and the individual plaintiffs' alleged pocketbook injury (costs of purchasing health insurance) is not fairly traceable to any Government action or conduct. Similarly, the state plaintiffs' alleged injuries, both indirect (increased costs to state-operated medical insurance programs) and direct (administrative and related expenses), are not traceable to the Government's enforcement of §5000A(a). The Court concluded that the lack of enforcement or threat of enforcement of §5000A(a) means that the plaintiffs' injuries are not redressable by a declaratory judgment that §5000A(a) is unconstitutional. The Court reversed the Fifth Circuit's judgment regarding standing, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case with instructions to dismiss.
