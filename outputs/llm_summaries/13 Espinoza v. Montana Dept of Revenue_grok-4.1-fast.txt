### 1. Facts of the Case
Petitioners Kendra Espinoza and two other mothers sued the Montana Department of Revenue in Montana state court after being blocked by Department "Rule 1" (Mont. Admin. Rule §42.4.802(1)(a) (2015)) from using scholarships from the Big Sky Scholarship organization for their children's tuition at Stillwater Christian School, a private Christian school meeting statutory criteria for qualified education providers under Mont. Code Ann. §15–30–3102(7). The scholarship program, enacted by the Montana Legislature in 2015 (2015 Mont. Laws p. 2168; Mont. Code Ann. §§15–30–3101 et seq.), provided tax credits of up to $150 to donors supporting organizations awarding scholarships for private school tuition, with $3 million allotted annually and automatic 10% increases if exhausted, set to expire in 2023. Big Sky Scholarships, the sole participating organization, focused on families facing financial hardship or with children with disabilities, awarding scholarships of $500 each (44 in 2017, 54 in 2018). The program was to be administered consistent with Montana Constitution Art. X, §6(1), barring aid to schools "controlled in whole or in part by any church, sect, or denomination." Rule 1 excluded religious schools to comply with this no-aid provision, despite objections from the Montana Attorney General. The trial court enjoined Rule 1, finding it unauthorized as the no-aid provision bars only appropriations, not tax credits. The Montana Supreme Court reversed (393 Mont. 446, 435 P.3d 603 (2018)), holding the unmodified program violated the no-aid provision by subsidizing tuition at religiously affiliated schools and lacked mechanisms to prevent aid to religious schools, invalidating the entire program. The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari (588 U.S. ___ (2019)).

### 2. Legal Question(s)
Whether the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment (applicable to the States via the Fourteenth Amendment) barred the Montana Supreme Court's application of Montana Constitution Art. X, §6(1) to invalidate a tax-credit scholarship program that would otherwise permit religious schools to receive indirect aid through parental choice, thereby excluding religious schools and families solely on the basis of the schools' religious status.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Court reversed the Montana Supreme Court (5-4, opinion by Chief Justice Roberts, joined by Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh, JJ.; concurrences by Thomas (joined by Gorsuch, J.), Alito, J., and Gorsuch, J.; dissents by Ginsburg (joined by Kagan, J.), Breyer (joined by Kagan, J. as to Part I), and Sotomayor, JJ.) and remanded. The application of Montana's no-aid provision violated the Free Exercise Clause by disqualifying otherwise eligible religious schools from public benefits solely because of their religious status, imposing a penalty on free exercise that triggers strict scrutiny (Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer, 582 U.S. ___ (2017)). The provision expressly bars aid to schools "controlled in whole or in part by any church, sect, or denomination" (Mont. Const., Art. X, §6(1)), discriminating based on status rather than religious use of funds. Distinguished Locke v. Davey, 540 U.S. 712 (2004), where denial targeted an "essentially religious endeavor" (devotional theology degrees) supported by a "historic and substantial" tradition against funding clergy; no comparable tradition bars aid to religious schools, and early governments often supported them. Rejected flexible case-by-case analysis as inconsistent with Trinity Lutheran. Montana's interests—greater church-state separation, promoting religious freedom, or protecting public education—failed strict scrutiny (Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 546 (1993)), as they were not compelling and the provision was underinclusive (barring only religious private schools). The Montana Supreme Court erred by applying the no-aid provision despite the Free Exercise violation; under the Supremacy Clause (Art. VI, cl. 2), it had no basis to invalidate the program and was obligated to disregard the provision (Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 178 (1803)). Precedent: A State deciding to subsidize private education cannot disqualify religious schools solely because of their religious character; such status-based discrimination triggers strict scrutiny under the Free Exercise Clause.
