The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit found the jury instructions as to the honest-services count were fatally flawed and remanded that charge for a new trial, but found no deficiencies in the conviction for computer fraud and affirmed that conviction."

The reference clearly states this was the Eleventh Circuit's ruling that was being reviewed, and the Sixth Circuit is mentioned only in passing as the circuit where Van Buren appealed (though this appears to be an error in the reference as well - Van Buren was from Georgia which is in the Eleventh Circuit).",

  "overall_assessment": "The generated summary captures the core holding and legal question accurately but contains notable factual errors including misidentifying the circuit court and oversimplifying the charges and procedural history. It also omits several important details such as the specific statutory language, the competing interpretations of the key phrase, the statutory history regarding purpose, and the composition of the dissent. The summary is moderately accurate but incomplete for a comprehensive understanding of the case.",
