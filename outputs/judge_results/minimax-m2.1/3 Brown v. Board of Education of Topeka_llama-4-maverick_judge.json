  "overall_assessment": "The generated summary is generally accurate and covers most key points including the core legal question, holding, and reasoning about segregation's detrimental effects. However, it contains a notable omission of Washington D.C. as one of the consolidated jurisdictions and misses some contextual details present in the reference, such as Warren's deliberate choice to write accessibly for non-lawyers and the procedural detail about restoration for relief arguments.",
