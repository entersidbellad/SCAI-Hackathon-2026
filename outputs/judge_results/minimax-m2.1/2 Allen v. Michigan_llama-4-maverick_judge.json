Challengers argued the map illegally packed Black voters into one district while dividing others, violating Section 2 VRA. The district court agreed and granted a preliminary injunction. The Supreme Court froze it 5-4 pending merits. The Court ultimately held the map likely violates Section 2 VRA under the Gingles framework."
