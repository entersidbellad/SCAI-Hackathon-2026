  "overall_assessment": "The generated summary is generally accurate and captures the core legal issues, holding, and reasoning effectively. However, it lacks specificity regarding the parties (failing to name Jacob Lewis or Epic Systems) and contains an inaccurate implication about a circuit split. While it correctly conveys the 5-4 decision and the majority/dissent positions, it omits several details from the reference including the specific date of filing, the exact waiver language, and Justice Thomas's precise concurrence reasoning.",
