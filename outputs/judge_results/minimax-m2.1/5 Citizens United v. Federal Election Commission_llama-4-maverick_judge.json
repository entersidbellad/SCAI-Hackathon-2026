  "overall_assessment": "The generated summary captures the core holding correctly (\u00a7441b is unconstitutional, disclosure requirements are constitutional) but is significantly incomplete. It omits critical details including the four specific legal questions, the 5-4 vote breakdown, the justices' alignments, the concurring and dissenting opinions, and the specific 'No. No. Yes. Yes.' answers to the legal questions. It also introduces an unsupported detail about video-on-demand that is not in the reference.",
