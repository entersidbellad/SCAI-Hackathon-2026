  "overall_assessment": "The generated summary is factually accurate and covers the core case facts, legal question, and holding well. However, it is incomplete as it omits the 8-1 vote breakdown, Justice Kagan's concurrence about poverty correlations with license suspensions, and Justice Sotomayor's dissent about burden of proof concerns. These omissions significantly reduce the summary's comprehensiveness.",
