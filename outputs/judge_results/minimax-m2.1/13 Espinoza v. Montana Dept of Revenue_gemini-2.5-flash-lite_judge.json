  "overall_assessment": "The generated summary is factually accurate and captures the core facts, legal question, and holding correctly. However, it is incomplete as it omits all concurrences and dissents, the 5-4 vote breakdown, and the specific authorship of the majority opinion by Chief Justice Roberts. These omissions significantly reduce the completeness score despite the summary being otherwise faithful to the reference.",
