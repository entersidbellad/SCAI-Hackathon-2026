  "overall_assessment": "The generated summary is factually accurate with additional verified details (dates, case numbers, property specifics) that complement the reference. However, it omits significant information including Knick's Fourth Amendment claim entirely and the specific second question about facial takings challenges. The summary correctly uses strong language ('overruled') without hedging, but the completeness score suffers due to these notable omissions.",
