      "issue": "The reference summary states the District Court ruled against the creditors (denied their challenge), but the generated summary incorrectly says the District Court 'denied the creditors' motions to dismiss' which is ambiguous and could imply the opposite outcome. More importantly, the reference indicates the District Court found the board is an instrumentality of the Commonwealth and members are not 'Officers of the United States' - the generated summary doesn't capture this key reasoning.",
      "correct_info": "The reference states: 'The federal district court in Puerto Rico ruled against the creditors, finding the board is an instrumentality of the Commonwealth government established pursuant to Congress's plenary powers under the Territorial Clause and that the board members are not \"Officers of the United States.\"'"
