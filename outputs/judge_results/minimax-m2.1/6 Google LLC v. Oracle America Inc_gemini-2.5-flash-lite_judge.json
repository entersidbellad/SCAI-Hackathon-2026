The summary accurately reflects that the Court assumed copyrightability rather than deciding it, properly analyzes all four fair use factors, and includes information about the dissent and Justice Barrett's non-participation. The terminology differences (e.g., 'declaring code' vs. 'lines') represent acceptable variation rather than errors.",
