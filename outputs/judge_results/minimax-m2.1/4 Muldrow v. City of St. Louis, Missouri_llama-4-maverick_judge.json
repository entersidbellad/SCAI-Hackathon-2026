  "overall_assessment": "The generated summary accurately captures the core facts, legal question, and holding of the case, but is incomplete in several respects. It omits the procedural history, the specific dollar amount of lost overtime pay, the unanimous nature of the decision, Justice Kagan's authorship, and all three concurring opinions (Thomas, Alito, and Kavanaugh) that provide important context about the Court's interpretation and disagreements. The summary is factually accurate but significantly less comprehensive than the reference summary.",
