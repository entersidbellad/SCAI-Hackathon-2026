Your job is to find ANY and ALL errors in AI-generated Supreme Court case summaries.\n\nCompare the GENERATED SUMMARY against the REFERENCE SUMMARY (ground truth).\n\n## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):\nFacts of the case\n\nNathan Van Buren was a sergeant with the Cumming, Georgia, Police Department. In that capacity, he came to know a man named Andrew Albo, who allegedly paid young prostitutes to spend time with him and then accused the women of stealing the money he gave them. Van Buren asked Albo for a loan, falsely claiming that he needed over $15,000 to settle his son's medical bills. Unbeknownst to Van Buren, Albo recorded the conversation in which Van Buren requested the loan. Albo presented the recording to a detective in the Forsyth County Sheriff's Office, alleging that Van Buren was \"shaking him down for his money.\" As a result, the FBI conducted a sting operation to test how far Van Buren was willing to go for money. As part of the sting operation, Albo asked Van Buren to look into a woman Albo named, to see whether she was an undercover officer before he would provide Van Buren with the full amount of money Van Buren requested. Van Buren searched the woman's information in a government database maintained by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) and the FBI. The next day, FBI and GBI agents confronted Van Buren, and Van Buren admitted to the fake story about his son to get the loan from Albo, his use of the government database to search for the woman Albo mentioned might be an undercover officer, and that he understood the purpose of searching the database was to discover and reveal to Albo whether the woman was an undercover officer.\n\nA federal grand jury charged Van Buren with one count of honest-services wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1343 and 1346, and one count of felony computer fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030. A jury convicted Van Buren on both counts, and Van Buren appealed his convictions. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit found the jury instructions as to the honest-services count were fatally flawed and remanded that charge for a new trial. It found no deficiencies in the conviction for computer fraud and affirmed that conviction, citing Eleventh Circuit precedent holding that a person with authority to access a computer can be guilty of computer fraud if that person subsequently misuses the computer.\n\nQuestion\nDoes a person who is authorized to access information on a computer for certain purposes violate Section 1030(a)(2) of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act if he accesses that information for an improper purpose?\n\nConclusion\nAn individual \"exceeds authorized access\" under Section 1030(a)(2) of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 when he accesses a computer with authorization and obtains information located in particular areas of the computer that are off-limits to him, not simply when he obtains information available to him with improper motives. Justice Amy Coney Barrett authored the 6-3 majority opinion of the Court.\n\nUnder Section 1030(e)(6), an individual \"exceeds authorized access\" when he \"access[es] a computer with authorization\" and \"use[s] such access to obtain . . . information in the computer that the accesser is not entitled so to obtain.\" The parties in this case agreed that Van Buren was entitled to obtain the license-plate information, but they disagreed that he was \"entitled so to obtain\" it.\" Van Buren argued that the phrase means information one is not allowed to obtain \"by using a computer that he is authorized to access,\" while the government argued that it meant information one was not allowed to obtain \"in the particular manner or circumstances in which he obtained it.\" The Court found Van Buren's interpretation more plausible and natural than the government's, and the statute's structure further supports that interpretation. Moreover, the statutory history\u2014Congress's choice to remove the statute's reference to purpose\u2014lends still further support to Van Buren's reading. Finally, to adopt the government's interpretation \"would attach criminal penalties to a breathtaking amount of commonplace computer activity\" and would inject arbitrariness into the assessment of criminal liability.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas authored a dissenting opinion, which Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito joined, arguing that \"the text, ordinary principles of property law, and statutory history\" support the government's proposed interpretation of the provision.\n\n\n## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):\nHere is a summary of the Supreme Court's opinion in *Van Buren v. United States*:\n\n## Summary of *Van Buren v. United States*\n\n### 1. Facts of the Case\n\nNathan Van Buren, a former police sergeant for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, was charged with a felony violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 (CFAA). The charges stemmed from his actions while on duty, where he used his patrol-car computer and his own valid credentials to access a law enforcement database. Van Buren conducted a search for a specific license plate number in exchange for money, approximately $5,000, from an individual named Andrew Albo. Unbeknownst to Van Buren, his actions were part of a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) sting operation.\n\nVan Buren's conduct violated a department policy that prohibited obtaining database information for non-law-enforcement purposes. The government argued that this violation of departmental policy also constituted a violation of the CFAA. A jury convicted Van Buren, and he was sentenced to 18 months in prison. Van Buren appealed, arguing that the CFAA's \"exceeds authorized access\" clause only applies to individuals who access information to which their computer access does not extend, not to those who misuse access they otherwise possess. The Eleventh Circuit, adhering to its precedent, affirmed the conviction. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve a split among the federal circuit courts regarding the interpretation of this clause.\n\n### 2. Legal Question(s)\n\nThe central legal question before the Supreme Court was the interpretation of the phrase \"exceeds authorized access\" as defined in the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 (CFAA). Specifically, the Court addressed:\n\n*   Whether the CFAA's provision making it illegal to \"intentionally accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access\" and thereby obtains information, when read in conjunction with the definition of \"exceeds authorized access\" as \"to access a computer with authorization and to use such access to obtain or alter information in the computer that the accesser is not entitled so to obtain or alter\" (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030(a)(2), (e)(6)), applies to an individual who has authorization to access a computer and its information but uses that access for an improper purpose that violates a departmental policy.\n*   More narrowly, what does the phrase \"is not entitled so to obtain\" mean within the definition of \"exceeds authorized access\"?\n\n### 3. Conclusion/Holding\n\nThe Supreme Court held that an individual \"exceeds authorized access\" under the CFAA when they access a computer with authorization but then obtain information located in particular areas of the computer\u2014such as specific files, folders, or databases\u2014that are off-limits to them. The Court ruled that Van Buren did not violate the CFAA because he had authorization to access the law enforcement database and was entitled to obtain the type of information he retrieved (license plate information). His violation was one of departmental policy regarding the *purpose* for which he obtained the information, not a violation of his *access* to the information itself.\n\nThe Court reasoned that the phrase \"entitled so to obtain\" refers to the entitlement to obtain information in the *manner* previously stated in the statute, which is by using a computer one is authorized to access. The word \"so\" acts as a term of reference, pointing back to the authorized manner of access. Therefore, if an individual is authorized to access a computer and the information within it, they do not \"exceed authorized access\" by obtaining that information for an improper purpose. The Court found that the government's interpretation would criminalize a vast amount of commonplace computer activity, such as employees sending personal emails on work computers, which was not the intent of the CFAA. The Court reversed the Eleventh Circuit's judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings.\n\n## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:\n   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?\n   - **Severity Assessment**:\n     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**\n     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**\n     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**\n\n2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:\n   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**\n   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**\n\n3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:\n   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**\n   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**\n\n## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):\nScore based on the *worst* error found.
