Your job is to find ANY and ALL errors in AI-generated Supreme Court case summaries.\n\nCompare the GENERATED SUMMARY against the REFERENCE SUMMARY (ground truth).\n\n## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):\nFacts of the case\n\nEmployees of the City of Ontario, California police department filed a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim in a California federal district court against the police department, city, chief of police, and an internal affairs officer. They alleged Fourth Amendment violations in relation to the police department's review of text messages made by an employee on a city issued text-message pager. While the city did not have an official text-messaging privacy policy, it did have a general \"Computer Usage, Internet and E-mail Policy.\" The policy in part stated that \"[t]he City of Ontario reserves the right to monitor and log all network activity including e-mail and Internet use, with or without notice,\" and that \"[u]sers should have no expectation of privacy or confidentiality when using these resources.\" Employees were told verbally that the text-messaging pagers were considered e-mail and subject to the general policy. The district court entered judgment in favor of the defendants.\n\nOn appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in part. The court held that city employees had a reasonable expectation of privacy for the text messages they sent on their city-issued pagers because there was no text message privacy policy in place. Moreover, the court noted that the police department's review of the text messages was unreasonable because it could have used \"less intrusive methods\" to determine whether employees' had properly used the text messaging service.\n\nQuestion\n1) Does a city employee have a reasonable expectation of privacy in text messages transmitted on his city-issued pager when the police department has no official privacy policy for the pagers?\n\n2) Did the Ninth Circuit contravene Supreme Court precedent by analyzing whether the police department could have used \"less intrusive methods\" of reviewing text messages?\n\nConclusion\nNot answered. Yes. The Supreme Court held that the City of Ontario did not violate its employees' Fourth Amendment rights because the city's search of Mr. Quon's text messages was reasonable. With Justice Anthony M. Kennedy writing for the majority, the Court reasoned that even assuming that Mr. Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his text messages, the city's search of them was reasonable because it was motivated by a legitimate work-related purpose and was not excessive in scope. In reaching its conclusion, the Court rejected the Ninth Circuit's \"least intrusive\" means approach to the issue.\n\nJustice John Paul Stevens concurred. He observed that the majority had not settled on one of the three approaches enunciated in O'Connor v. Ortega for determining the parameters of a \"reasonable expectation of privacy.\" He reasoned that under any of the three approaches, Mr. Quon's expectations were not violated. Justice Antonin Scalia concurred in part and concurred in the judgment. He disagreed that the Court tacitly reaffirmed the O'Connor framework for determining whether the Fourth Amendment applies to public employees, arguing that it was \"standardless\" and \"unsupported.\"\n\n## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):\n### 1. Facts of the Case\nThe City of Ontario, California (City), Ontario Police Department (OPD), and OPD Chief Lloyd Scharf (petitioners) issued alphanumeric pagers capable of sending and receiving text messages to OPD SWAT team members, including respondent Jeff Quon, a police sergeant, in October 2001. The City's contract with Arch Wireless Operating Company limited each pager to 25,000 characters per month, with overages incurring additional fees. The City's Computer Usage, Internet and E-Mail Policy, acknowledged by Quon in March 2000, stated that users had no expectation of privacy in City computer resources, and OPD informed employees, including at an April 18, 2002, meeting attended by Quon and in a Chief Scharf memorandum dated April 29, 2002, that pager text messages were treated as e-mails subject to auditing. Quon exceeded his character limit multiple times starting in the first or second billing cycle, reimbursing the City each time after Lieutenant Steven Duke suggested this alternative to auditing. In August and September 2002, Quon and another officer again exceeded limits. In October 2002, Chief Scharf, tired of collecting overage fees, directed Duke to obtain transcripts from Arch Wireless to determine if the character limit was too low (requiring officers to pay for work-related messages) or if overages were personal. Arch Wireless provided transcripts after verifying the City as subscriber. Review by Duke, Scharf, and Quon's supervisor revealed many non-work-related and sexually explicit messages from Quon. Scharf referred the matter to OPD internal affairs; Sergeant Patrick McMahon redacted off-duty messages using Quon's work schedule and found that of 456 work-hour messages in August 2002, no more than 57 were work-related, leading to Quon's discipline for violating OPD rules.\n\nRespondents Jeff Quon, Jerilyn Quon (his then-separated wife), April Florio (OPD employee romantically involved with Jeff Quon), and Steve Trujillo (OPD SWAT member), each of whom exchanged texts with Jeff Quon in August and September 2002, sued petitioners, Arch Wireless, and another individual under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (Fourth Amendment), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2701 et seq. (Stored Communications Act, SCA), and California law, alleging violations by obtaining and reviewing Jeff Quon's transcripts. The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California denied respondents summary judgment on Fourth Amendment claims, found via jury that Scharf's purpose was legitimate (efficacy of limits, not time-wasting), and granted petitioners summary judgment, citing O\u2019Connor v. Ortega, 480 U.S. 709 (1987). The Ninth Circuit reversed in part, Quon v. Arch Wireless Operating Co., 529 F. 3d 892 (2008), holding the search unreasonable in scope despite legitimate rationale and that Arch Wireless violated the SCA; rehearing en banc denied, 554 F. 3d 769 (2009). The Supreme Court granted certiorari on petitioners' Fourth Amendment claims, 558 U.S. 1090 (2009), but denied Arch Wireless's petition on the SCA, USA Mobility Wireless, Inc. v. Quon, 558 U.S. 1091 (2009).\n\n### 2. Legal Question(s)\nThe Court addressed whether petitioners violated respondents' Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures by obtaining and reviewing transcripts of text messages sent and received on Jeff Quon's City-issued pager. The Court examined the analytical framework from O\u2019Connor v. Ortega for government employer searches, including whether Jeff Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his pager messages (considering the Computer Policy, OPD notices, and Duke's statements), whether petitioners' review constituted a Fourth Amendment search, and whether the warrantless search was reasonable under the O\u2019Connor plurality's two-step approach (operational realities of workplace for privacy expectation; then reasonableness under all circumstances for noninvestigatory work-related purposes or work-misconduct investigations) or Justice Scalia's concurrence (government offices generally protected, but searches reasonable/normal in private-employer context do not violate the Fourth Amendment). The Court also considered whether the search's reasonableness turned on Chief Scharf's intent or a \"least intrusive means\" test, and whether it extended unreasonably to messages sent to Jeff Quon by other respondents.\n\n### 3. Conclusion/Holding\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit, 529 F. 3d 892, holding that petitioners did not violate respondents' Fourth Amendment rights because the search of Jeff Quon's pager transcripts was reasonable. Justice Kennedy's opinion (joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Stevens, Thomas, Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito, and Sotomayor; Justice Scalia joined except Part III-A) assumed arguendo that Jeff Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy, that the review was a Fourth Amendment search, and that O\u2019Connor v. Ortega principles apply to employer-provided electronic devices. Under the O\u2019Connor plurality, 480 U.S. at 725-726, the search was justified at inception (jury-found legitimate work-related purpose: determining if 25,000-character limit met City needs and avoided officers paying for work messages or City subsidizing personal use); reasonable in scope (efficient/expedient review of only August-September 2002 transcripts for sample size; off-duty messages redacted by McMahon); and not excessively intrusive (Quon's limited privacy expectation as SWAT officer aware of auditing policy and scrutiny needs; less intrusive than personal email/wiretap). It satisfied Justice Scalia's approach, 480 U.S. at 732, as reasonable/normal in private-employer context. The Ninth Circuit erred by applying a \"least intrusive means\" test, rejected in Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 663 (1995), and cases like Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives\u2019 Assn., 489 U.S. 602 (1989). SCA issues were not before the Court and did not render the search per se unreasonable. Other respondents could not prevail, as they argued the search unreasonable only if unreasonable as to Jeff Quon. Justice Stevens concurred, noting no resolution of O\u2019Connor framework and Quon's limited expectation. Justice Scalia concurred in judgment/part, rejecting O\u2019Connor plurality's \"operational realities\" as standardless and unnecessary here. Precedent: Government employer searches of employee electronic communications are evaluated for reasonableness under O\u2019Connor even assuming privacy expectations; courts should avoid broad rules on evolving technology/workplace norms; no \"least intrusive means\" requirement.
