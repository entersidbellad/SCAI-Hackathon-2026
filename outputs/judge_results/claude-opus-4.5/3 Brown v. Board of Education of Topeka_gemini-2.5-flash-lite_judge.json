Your job is to find ANY and ALL errors in AI-generated Supreme Court case summaries.\n\nCompare the GENERATED SUMMARY against the REFERENCE SUMMARY (ground truth).\n\n## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):\nFacts of the case\nThis case was the consolidation of cases arising in Kansas, South Carolina, Virginia, Delaware, and Washington D.C. relating to the segregation of public schools on the basis of race. In each of the cases, African American students had been denied admittance to certain public schools based on laws allowing public education to be segregated by race. They argued that such segregation violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The plaintiffs were denied relief in the lower courts based on Plessy v. Ferguson, which held that racially segregated public facilities were legal so long as the facilities for blacks and whites were equal. (This was known as the \u201cseparate but equal\u201d doctrine.) \n\nQuestion\nDoes the segregation of public education based solely on race violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\n\nConclusion\nSeparate but equal educational facilities for racial minorities is inherently unequal, violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nChief Justice Earl Warren delivered the opinion of the unanimous Court. The Supreme Court held that \u201cseparate but equal\u201d facilities are inherently unequal and violate the protections of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court reasoned that the segregation of public education based on race instilled a sense of inferiority that had a hugely detrimental effect on the education and personal growth of African American children. Warren based much of his opinion on information from social science studies rather than court precedent. The decision also used language that was relatively accessible to non-lawyers because Warren felt it was necessary for all Americans to understand its logic. \n\n## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):\nHere is a summary of the Supreme Court opinion in *Brown v. Board of Education*:\n\n**1. Facts of the Case**\n\nThis case consolidated four separate lawsuits from Kansas, South Carolina, Virginia, and Delaware. In each instance, minor plaintiffs of the Negro race, through their legal representatives, sought admission to public schools on a nonsegregated basis. They alleged that state laws requiring or permitting racial segregation in public schools denied them the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. In three of the cases (Kansas, South Carolina, and Virginia), three-judge federal district courts denied relief, relying on the \"separate but equal\" doctrine established in *Plessy v. Ferguson*, 163 U. S. 537, even though some found the facilities for Negro children to be inferior and ordered equalization. In the Delaware case, the Delaware Court of Chancery ordered the admission of Negro children to white schools due to the inferiority of the Negro schools, a decision affirmed by the Delaware Supreme Court. The Supreme Court of Delaware, however, indicated that a modification of the decree might be possible after equalization of the Negro and white schools. The cases reached the Supreme Court due to the significant constitutional question presented regarding the legality of state-mandated segregation in public education.\n\n**2. Legal Question(s)**\n\nThe central legal question before the Supreme Court was whether segregation of children in public schools solely on the basis of race, even if the physical facilities and other tangible factors are equal, deprives children of the minority group of equal educational opportunities and thus violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court also considered the historical context of the Fourteenth Amendment and its intended application to public education, as well as the continued validity of the \"separate but equal\" doctrine in the context of public schooling.\n\n**3. Conclusion/Holding**\n\nThe Supreme Court unanimously held that segregation of children in public schools solely on the basis of race is unconstitutional and violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court reasoned that while the history of the Fourteenth Amendment is inconclusive regarding its specific application to public education, the issue must be decided in light of the present-day importance of public education in American society. The Court found that education is a fundamental right that must be available to all on equal terms. It concluded that segregation, even with equal tangible facilities, generates a feeling of inferiority in minority children, thereby depriving them of equal educational opportunities. The Court explicitly rejected the \"separate but equal\" doctrine as having no place in the field of public education, stating that \"separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.\" The Court then restored the cases to the docket for further argument on the specific forms of decrees to be implemented, acknowledging the complexity of desegregating public school systems.\n\n## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:\n   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?\n   - **Severity Assessment**:\n     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**\n     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**\n     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**\n\n2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:\n   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**\n   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**\n\n3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:\n   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**\n   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**\n\n## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):\nScore based on the *worst* error found.
