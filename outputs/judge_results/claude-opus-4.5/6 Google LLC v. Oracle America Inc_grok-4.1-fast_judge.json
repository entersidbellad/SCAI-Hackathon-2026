  "_prompt_used": "You are a highly critical, pedantic legal scholar auditor. Your job is to find ANY and ALL errors in AI-generated Supreme Court case summaries.\n\nCompare the GENERATED SUMMARY against the REFERENCE SUMMARY (ground truth).\n\n## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):\nFacts of the case\n\nWhen Google implemented its Android Operating System (Android OS), it wrote its own programming language based on Java, which is owned by Oracle. To facilitate developers writing their own programs for Android OS, Google's version used the same names, organization, and functionality as Java's Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).\n\nOracle sued Google for copyright infringement, but the federal district judge held that APIs are not subject to copyright because permitting a private entity to own the copyright to a programming language would stifle innovation and collaboration, contrary to the goals of copyright. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the lower court, finding that the Java APIs are copyrightable but leaving open the possibility of a fair use defense. The U.S. Supreme Court denied Google's petition for certiorari.\n\nUpon remand to the district court, a jury found that Google's use of the Java API was fair use. Oracle appealed, and the Federal Circuit again reversed the lower court. The Federal Circuit held that Google's use was not fair as a matter of law.\n\nQuestion\n1. Does copyright protection extend to a software interface? \n2. If so, does the petitioner's use of a software interface in the context of creating a new computer program constitute fair use?\n\nConclusion\nAssuming a software interface may be subject to copyright protection, Google's limited copying of the Java SE Application Programming Interface constituted a fair use of that material under copyright law. Justice Stephen Breyer authored the 6-2 majority opinion.\n\nCopyright law aims to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by simultaneously granting creators exclusive copyrights and limiting the scope of such rights through the fair use doctrine. To decide no more than necessary to resolve the case, the Court assumed that software code is subject to copyright protection.\n\nCourts consider four statutory factors in evaluating whether a secondary use is fair. First, Google's use of the Java APIs is transformative. Google copied only what was necessary to allow programmers to work in a different computing environment but with a familiar programming language. Second, the copied lines are \"inherently bound together with uncopyrightable ideas,\" suggesting that the application of fair use to this context is unlikely to undermine the general copyright protection that Congress provided for computer programs. Third, Google copied only .4% of the entire API, weighing in favor of fair use. Finally, the record shows that Google's new smartphone platform is not a market substitute for Java SE. Because all four factors support a finding of fair use, Google's limited copying constituted fair use.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas authored a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Samuel Alito joined, arguing that the Court should have addressed the question whether Oracle's code is copyrightable. Justice Thomas would have concluded that it is, and then he would have found that Google's use of that copyrighted code was not fair. By copying Oracle's code, Google \"erased 97.5% of the value of Oracle's partnership with Amazon, made tens of billions of dollars, and established its position as the owner of the largest mobile operating system in the world.\"\n\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.\n\n\n## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):\n### 1. Facts of the Case\nOracle America, Inc., the owner of a copyright in Java SE\u2014a computer platform using the Java programming language\u2014sued Google LLC in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in 2010, alleging copyright infringement. In 2005, Google acquired Android, Inc., and sought to develop an open software platform for mobile devices like smartphones. To attract the approximately six million programmers familiar with Java, Google copied roughly 11,500 lines of declaring code from the Java SE Application Programming Interface (API)\u2014specifically, the declaring code and structure, sequence, and organization (SSO) for 37 packages\u2014without permission, while writing its own implementing code (millions of lines) tailored for smartphones. This copying enabled Java programmers to use familiar method calls (e.g., \"java.lang.Math.max(4, 6)\") to invoke tasks on Android. Negotiations for a license between Google and Sun Microsystems (Oracle's predecessor) broke down due to disagreements over interoperability and openness.\n\nLitigation proceeded in phases: A jury rejected Oracle's patent claims, found limited copyright infringement, but deadlocked on fair use; the District Court ruled the API declaring code not copyrightable under 17 U.S.C. \u00a7102(b) as a \"system or method of operation\" (Oracle America, Inc. v. Google Inc., 872 F. Supp. 2d 974 (ND Cal. 2012)). The Federal Circuit reversed, holding the declaring code and SSO copyrightable (Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc., 750 F. 3d 1339 (CA Fed. 2014)). The Supreme Court denied certiorari (Google, Inc. v. Oracle America, Inc., 576 U. S. 1071 (2015)). On remand, a jury found Google's use a fair use. The Federal Circuit reversed again, holding no fair use as a matter of law (886 F. 3d 1179 (CA Fed. 2018)), and remanded for damages. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on both copyrightability and fair use.\n\n### 2. Legal Question(s)\nThe Court addressed: (1) whether the 11,500 lines of Java SE API declaring code and SSO for 37 packages are copyrightable, particularly in light of 17 U.S.C. \u00a7102(b) excluding \"any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery\"; and (2) if copyrightable, whether Google's copying constituted \"fair use\" under 17 U.S.C. \u00a7107, which provides limitations on exclusive rights and directs consideration of four factors: (1) purpose and character of the use; (2) nature of the copyrighted work; (3) amount and substantiality of the portion used; and (4) effect upon the potential market or value. To decide no more than necessary, the Court assumed arguendo that the API was copyrightable and focused solely on fair use. The Court also held that fair use is a mixed question of law and fact, with underlying facts reviewed for substantial evidence but the ultimate legal question reviewed de novo, consistent with the Seventh Amendment.\n\n### 3. Conclusion/Holding\nThe Court held, 6-2, that Google's copying of the Java SE API declaring code was a fair use as a matter of law, reversing the Federal Circuit (886 F. 3d 1179) and remanding. Justice Breyer delivered the opinion, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh; Justice Barrett took no part; Justice Thomas dissented, joined by Justice Alito.\n\n**Reasoning**: Fair use under \u00a7107 is a flexible, equitable doctrine accounting for technological changes and the functional nature of computer programs, serving as a context-based check on copyright monopolies to promote progress under Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 8. All four factors favored fair use:\n\n- **Nature of the work (\u00a7107(2))**: Favors fair use; the API declaring code is a user interface (not core creative expression like implementing code), inherently bound with uncopyrightable ideas (task organization), method calls, and programmer investment, unlike typical programs.\n- **Purpose/character (\u00a7107(1))**: Favors fair use; transformative as Google reimplemented the interface only as needed for a new smartphone platform/environment, enabling programmers' skills in Android (a distinct, open system), furthering innovation (e.g., industry reimplementations like Sun's own); commerciality not dispositive.\n- **Amount/substantiality (\u00a7107(3))**: Favors fair use; 11,500 lines (0.4% of 2.86 million total API lines) were quantitatively small relative to the whole and qualitatively tethered to the transformative purpose (compatibility for programmers), not copied for creativity.\n- **Market effects (\u00a7107(4))**: Favors fair use; Android not a substitute for Java SE (desktop/laptop focus; Sun/Oracle failed in smartphones); Oracle benefited from Java ecosystem expansion; enforcement risks public harm by locking innovation (programmer lock-in).\n\nThe holding applies fair use precedents (e.g., Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U. S. 569 (1994); Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U. S. 539 (1985); Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U. S. 417 (1984)) to functional computer interfaces without overruling them, recognizing Congress's 1980 extension of copyright to programs (\u00a7101) and intent for case-by-case fair use application.\n\n## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:\n   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?\n   - **Severity Assessment**:\n     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**\n     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**\n     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**\n\n2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:\n   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**\n   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**\n\n3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:\n   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**\n   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**\n\n## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):\nScore based on the *worst* error found.
