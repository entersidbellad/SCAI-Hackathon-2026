Your job is to find ANY and ALL errors in AI-generated Supreme Court case summaries.\n\nCompare the GENERATED SUMMARY against the REFERENCE SUMMARY (ground truth).\n\n## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):\nFacts of the case\nSergeant Muldrow, initially assigned to the Intelligence Division where she worked on various high-profile cases and was deputized by the FBI, was transferred to the Fifth District by Interim Police Commissioner Lawrence O'Toole's appointee, Captain Deeba. This change led to a different work schedule, responsibilities, and loss of special FBI-related privileges including a potential $17,500 in annual overtime pay. After her transfer, Sergeant Muldrow was asked to return FBI-issued equipment, which she did, and her Task Force Officer status was revoked. She filed a discrimination charge with the Missouri Commission on Human Rights against the City of St. Louis and Captain Deeba, later filing an action in Missouri state court alleging Title VII violations.\n\nThe case was removed to federal court, where the district court granted summary judgment against her Title VII claims and dismissed her state law claims. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed, holding that the employment decisions she alleged did not constitute \u201cadverse employment action\u201d and thus did not establish a prima facie case of gender discrimination under Title VII, nor were they \u201cmaterially adverse action\u201d as required for a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII.\n\nQuestion\nDoes Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibit discrimination in transfer decisions absent a separate court determination that the transfer decision caused a signification disadvantage?\n\nConclusion\nAn employee challenging a job transfer under Title VII must show that the transfer brought about some harm with respect to an identifiable term or condition of employment, but that harm need not be significant. Although the judgment vacating and remanding the case was unanimous, Justice Elena Kagan authored the majority opinion of the Court, which was joined by five other Justices.\n\nNothing in Title VII\u2019s text requires a transferred employee to show that the harm they suffered was \u201csignificant.\u201d Rather, as long as the transfer left the employee worse off in some way with respect to their employment terms or conditions, and was made because of a protected characteristic like sex or race, it violates Title VII\u2019s prohibition on discrimination. There is no basis for reading a heightened \u201csignificant harm\u201d standard into the statute. Title VII targets employment practices that treat a person worse because of a protected trait, without distinguishing between significant and less significant harms. While concerns about frivolous lawsuits are valid, courts have other ways to dismiss meritless claims without imposing an extra-textual \"significant harm\" requirement.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas authored an opinion concurring in the judgment suggesting that the majority misinterpreted the opinion by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, below. Justice Thomas argued that the appeals court\u2019s language requiring \u201ca tangible change in working conditions that produces a material employment disadvantage\u201d is not a heightened-harm requirement.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito authored an opinion concurring in the judgment criticizing the majority for failing to clarify the degree of harm required under Title VII, arguing that there is \u201clittle if any substantive difference between the terminology the Court approves and the terminology it doesn\u2019t like.\u201d\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh authored an opinion concurring in the judgment, arguing that while he agrees with the majority in rejecting the \u201csignificant employment disadvantage\u201d requirement, he disagrees with its new standard requiring \u201csome harm.\u201d Justice Kavanaugh provided an example of a situation that clearly violates Title VII but may not satisfy the majority\u2019s \u201csome harm\u201d requirement: \u201cWe are transferring you to the Cincinnati office because you are black. But your compensation will not change.\u201d Any transfer on a discriminatory basis\u2014no matter how quantifiable the harm\u2014should be a violation of Title VII.\n\n## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):\n### 1. Facts of the Case\nSergeant Jatonya Clayborn Muldrow, a plainclothes officer in the St. Louis Police Department's Intelligence Division from 2008 to 2017, investigated public corruption and human trafficking cases, oversaw the Gang Unit, served as head of the Gun Crimes Unit, and was deputized as a Task Force Officer with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which provided her FBI credentials, an unmarked take-home vehicle, and authority to pursue investigations outside St. Louis. In 2017, the new Intelligence Division commander, Captain Michael Deeba, requested Muldrow's transfer to replace her with a male officer, referring to her as \"Mrs.\" rather than \"Sergeant\" and testifying that the male officer was a better fit for the Division's \"very dangerous\" work. The Department approved the involuntary transfer over Muldrow's objections, reassigning her to a uniformed supervisory position in the Fifth District. Her rank and pay remained unchanged, but her responsibilities shifted from working with high-ranking officials on departmental priorities to supervising neighborhood patrol officers' day-to-day activities (including approving arrests, reviewing reports, and handling administrative matters, with some patrol work herself); she lost her FBI deputization and take-home vehicle; and her schedule changed from a regular Monday-through-Friday week to a rotating schedule often involving weekend shifts. Muldrow filed suit against the City of St. Louis, Missouri, and others under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1), alleging sex discrimination with respect to the terms or conditions of her employment. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri granted summary judgment to the City (2020 WL 5505113), holding that Muldrow failed to show a \"significant\" change producing \"material employment disadvantage\" under Circuit precedent. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed (30 F. 4th 680), concluding the transfer caused no \"materially significant disadvantage\" as it involved no change in title, salary, or benefits and only \"minor changes in working conditions,\" with Muldrow retaining a supervisory role involving serious crime investigations. The Supreme Court granted certiorari (600 U.S. ___ (2023)) to resolve a Circuit split on whether Title VII transfer claims require a heightened harm threshold.\n\n### 2. Legal Question(s)\nWhether, to prevail on a Title VII discrimination claim challenging an involuntary job transfer under 42 U.S.C. \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1)\u2014which makes it unlawful to \"discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s . . . sex\"\u2014an employee must demonstrate that the transfer caused a \"significant,\" \"material,\" \"serious,\" or similarly heightened level of harm or disadvantage to an identifiable term or condition of employment, beyond merely showing some injurious or disadvantageous change in such a term or condition.\n\n### 3. Conclusion/Holding\nThe Supreme Court vacated the Eighth Circuit's judgment and remanded in a 6-3 decision (No. 22\u2013193, decided April 17, 2024; cite as 601 U.S. ____ (2024)), with Justice Kagan writing for the Court (joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Sotomayor, Gorsuch, Barrett, and Jackson); Justices Thomas, Alito, and Kavanaugh each filed separate opinions concurring in the judgment. The Court held that a Title VII plaintiff challenging a discriminatory job transfer must show some harm or injurious change respecting an identifiable term or condition of employment (e.g., responsibilities, perks, or schedule), but need not meet any heightened \"significance,\" \"materiality,\" or similar threshold, as such a requirement adds words to the statutory text. The Court reasoned that \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1)'s prohibition on \"discriminat[ing] against\" an individual \"with respect to\" employment \"terms [or] conditions\" because of sex (citing Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 80 (1998); Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644, 657, 658, 681 (2020); Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 64 (1986)) requires only \"differences in treatment that injure\" employees tied to such terms or conditions, without textual support for an elevated harm bar that could exclude non-\"significant\" injuries. The Court rejected the City's ejusdem generis argument (comparing \"fail or refuse to hire,\" \"discharge,\" or \"otherwise . . . discriminate against\"), noting the provision's parts share the trait of being employment actions rather than requiring equivalent harm levels. It distinguished Burlington Northern & Santa Fe R. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 63, 68 (2006), which imposed a \"materially adverse\" (significant harm) standard for Title VII's separate anti-retaliation provision (\u00a72000e\u20133(a)) to deter only actions dissuading reasonable workers from filing charges\u2014a rationale inapplicable to the anti-discrimination provision's flat prevention of status-based injury. Policy concerns about flooding courts were dismissed, as courts can filter meritless claims via requirements of injury to terms/conditions, discriminatory intent (\"because of\" sex), forfeiture, and proof; Congress could have added a significance limit if desired (citing EEOC v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc., 575 U.S. 768, 774 (2015)). Muldrow's allegations\u2014if properly preserved and proven\u2014satisfied the correct standard, as the transfer worsened her terms/conditions in multiple ways (e.g., from plainclothes Intelligence Division role with priority investigations, networking, regular schedule, and take-home vehicle to uniformed patrol supervision with administrative focus, irregular weekends, and lost vehicle), regardless of unchanged rank/pay. Issues of forfeiture (e.g., District Court's note that Muldrow did not argue schedule/vehicle changes against summary judgment; 2020 WL 5505113, *9, n.20) and evidentiary support were left for remand under the proper standard. The decision rejected heightened-harm precedents in Circuits including the Eighth (e.g., 30 F. 4th 680), First, Second, Fourth, Seventh, Tenth, and Eleventh, aligning with the D.C. Circuit's en banc ruling in Chambers v. District of Columbia, 35 F. 4th 870 (2022).\n\n## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:\n   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?\n   - **Severity Assessment**:\n     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**\n     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**\n     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**\n\n2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:\n   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**\n   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**\n\n3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:\n   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**\n   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**\n\n## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):\nScore based on the *worst* error found.
