Your job is to find ANY and ALL errors in AI-generated Supreme Court case summaries.\n\nCompare the GENERATED SUMMARY against the REFERENCE SUMMARY (ground truth).\n\n## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):\nFacts of the case\n\nEpic Systems Corporation (Epic) is a Wisconsin-based healthcare data management software company. Epic has an arbitration agreement that requires its employees to resolve any employment-based disputes with Epic through individual arbitration and to waive their right to participate in or receive benefit from any class, collective, or representative proceedings. In February 2015, former Epic employee Jacob Lewis sued Epic in federal court individually and on behalf of similarly-situated employees and claimed that they had been denied overtime wages in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Epic moved to dismiss the complaint and cited the waiver clause of its arbitration agreement. The district court denied Epic's motion and held that the waiver was unenforceable because it violated the right of employees to engage in \"concerted activities\" under Section Seven of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the lower court's decision and added that the waiver was also unenforceable under the savings clause of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). That clause provides that arbitration agreements are to be enforced unless there legal or equitable grounds that would render a contract unenforceable. Finding the waiver of collective proceedings illegal under the NLRA, the appellate court held that the arbitration agreement was unenforceable under the FAA. This case was consolidated with Ernst & Young v. Morris and National Labor Relations Board v. Murphy Oil USA, Inc., both cases that dealt with the relationship between the FAA and the NLRA.\n\nQuestion\nDoes the National Labor Relations Act prohibit enforcement of an agreement requiring employees to resolve disputes with the employer through individual arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act?\n\nConclusion\nThe Court held that neither the Arbitration Act's saving clause nor the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) supersede Congress's instructions in the Federal Arbitration Act that arbitration agreements providing for individualized proceedings must be enforced. Justice Neil Gorsuch delivered the opinion for a 5-4 majority. The majority found that the Federal Arbitration Act \"instructed federal courts to enforce arbitration agreements according to their terms\" and that the NLRA \"does not mention class or collection action procedures\" and thus cannot be read to displace the Arbitration Act.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion to add that \"the employees also cannot prevail under the plain meaning of the Federal Arbitration Act.\"\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan joined. The dissent noted the extreme imbalance between employer and employee and Congress's attempt to remedy that imbalance in passing the NLRA and its forerunner, the Norris-LaGuardia Act. In this context, the dissent found that the Federal Arbitration Act should not shrink the NLRA's \"protective sphere.\"\n\n\n## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):\nHere is a summary of the Supreme Court's opinion in *Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis*:\n\n## Summary of *Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis*\n\n### 1. Facts of the Case\n\nThis case consolidated three separate lawsuits brought by employees against their employers. In each instance, the employees had entered into employment contracts that included mandatory arbitration clauses requiring that any disputes be resolved through individualized arbitration proceedings. Despite these agreements, the employees sought to litigate claims related to wage and hour laws, specifically the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and related state laws, through class or collective actions in federal court. The employers moved to compel arbitration based on the agreements. The employees argued that these arbitration agreements, by mandating individualized proceedings and prohibiting class or collective actions, violated the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and therefore should not be enforced under the \"saving clause\" of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) had previously taken the position that the NLRA effectively nullified the FAA in such cases, a position that had been adopted by some lower courts. However, the Executive Branch, through the Solicitor General, presented a different view. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve this conflict.\n\n### 2. Legal Question(s)\n\nThe central legal question before the Supreme Court was whether employment contracts requiring individualized arbitration, thereby precluding employees from bringing class or collective actions, are enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act, or if such agreements are rendered unlawful by the National Labor Relations Act.\n\nSpecifically, the Court addressed:\n* Whether the \"saving clause\" of the Federal Arbitration Act, which allows for the revocation of arbitration agreements on grounds applicable to any contract, permits the refusal to enforce arbitration agreements that mandate individualized proceedings based on a claim that such provisions violate the National Labor Relations Act.\n* Whether the National Labor Relations Act, through its provisions protecting employees' rights to engage in \"concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection,\" implicitly prohibits employers from requiring employees to waive their right to participate in class or collective actions in arbitration or litigation.\n\n### 3. Conclusion/Holding\n\nThe Supreme Court held that Congress has instructed, through the Federal Arbitration Act, that arbitration agreements providing for individualized proceedings must be enforced as written. The Court ruled that neither the FAA's saving clause nor the NLRA provides a basis for invalidating these agreements.\n\nThe Court reasoned that the FAA establishes a strong federal policy favoring arbitration and requires courts to enforce arbitration agreements according to their terms. The saving clause of the FAA allows for the revocation of arbitration agreements only on grounds that apply to contracts generally, such as fraud or unconscionability, and not on defenses that specifically target arbitration or interfere with its fundamental attributes. The Court found that prohibiting individualized arbitration proceedings, as the employees argued, directly interferes with a fundamental attribute of arbitration.\n\nFurthermore, the Court concluded that the NLRA does not conflict with the FAA. Section 7 of the NLRA protects employees' rights to organize and engage in collective bargaining and other concerted activities. However, the Court found no clear and manifest congressional intent within the NLRA to displace the FAA or to create a right to class or collective action procedures in litigation or arbitration. The Court noted that the NLRA was enacted before modern class action procedures were well-developed and that the phrase \"other concerted activities\" should be interpreted in context with the specific activities listed, which relate to unionization and collective bargaining, not procedural rights in court or arbitration. The Court also emphasized the strong presumption against implied repeals of statutes and the need to interpret statutes harmoniously. The Court found no basis to defer to the NLRB's interpretation, as the agency sought to interpret one statute in a way that limited the scope of another statute it did not administer, and the Executive Branch itself presented conflicting views.\n\nTherefore, the Court reversed the judgments in *Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis* (No. 16\u2013285) and *Ernst & Young LLP v. Morris* (No. 16\u2013300), and affirmed the judgment in *National Labor Relations Board v. Murphy Oil USA, Inc.* (No. 16\u2013307), holding that employment agreements requiring individualized arbitration are enforceable.\n\n## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:\n   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?\n   - **Severity Assessment**:\n     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**\n     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**\n     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**\n\n2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:\n   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**\n   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**\n\n3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:\n   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**\n   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**\n\n## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):\nScore based on the *worst* error found.
