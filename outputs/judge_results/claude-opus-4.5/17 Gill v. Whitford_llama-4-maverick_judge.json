Your job is to find ANY and ALL errors in AI-generated Supreme Court case summaries.\n\nCompare the GENERATED SUMMARY against the REFERENCE SUMMARY (ground truth).\n\n## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):\nFacts of the case\n\nIn 2010, for the first time in over forty years, Wisconsin voters elected a Republican majority in the state assembly and the senate, and a Republican governor. As a result, the Republican leadership developed a voting district map that its drafters calculated would allow Republicans to maintain a majority under any likely voting scenario. The redistricting plan was introduced in July 2011, and both the senate and the assembly passed the bill shortly thereafter. The governor signed the bill into law in August 2011. Even before it was enacted, the plan faced two legal challenges, on constitutional and statutory grounds. A federal court upheld the plan as not violating the \"one person one vote\" principle nor violating the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nPlaintiffs in this case challenge the plan as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. At issue is whether the plan systematically dilutes the voting strength of Democratic voters statewide.\n\nQuestion\n1. Did the district court err in holding that it had the authority to hear a statewide challenge to Wisconsin's redistricting plan, rather than requiring a district-by-district analysis?\n2. Did the district court err in holding that the redistricting plan was an unconstitutional gerrymander?\n3. Did the district court use an incorrect test for a gerrymander?\n4. Are defendants entitled to present evidence that they would have prevailed under the gerrymander test actually used by the district court?\n5. Are partisan gerrymandering claims justiciable?\n\nConclusion\nThe plaintiffs failed to demonstrate Article III standing, so there is no need to resolve any of the questions presented. In a unanimous decision authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Court sidestepped (for now) all of the key issues regarding partisan gerrymandering, resolving the case instead on the technical issue of judicial standing. For a plaintiff to bring a case in federal court, she must have Article III standing, which requires showing three elements, one of which is \"injury in fact.\" To show injury in fact, a plaintiff must show that she has suffered \"invasion of a legally protected interest\" that is \"concrete and particularized.\" In this case, the Court found that the plaintiffs alleged but did not prove individual harms, providing evidence instead only of statewide harms of alleged partisan gerrymandering. The Court thus vacated the judgment of the district court and remanded for further proceedings.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, in which Justice Neil Gorsuch joined. Justices Thomas and Gorsuch did not join the majority with respect to the decision to remand the case and allow the plaintiffs a second chance to prove standing and thus wrote separately to express this disagreement with the disposition.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan filed a concurring opinion in which Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, and Sonia Sotomayor joined. Justice Kagan agreed with the findings and conclusions of the Court but wrote separately, in essence, to describe how the plaintiffs might proceed upon remand. Justice Kagan suggests that the plaintiffs might present more than simply a vote dilution theory, but also an infringement of their First Amendment right of association. Such a claim, according to Justice Kagan, would not require the plaintiffs to show injury-in-fact in the form of injury to her particular voting district because that claim would be statewide in nature. She predicts that partisan gerrymandering \"injures enough individuals and organizations in enough concrete ways . . . that standing requirements, properly applied, will not often or long prevent courts from reaching the merits of cases like this one.\"\n\n\n## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):\n### Summary of Gill v. Whitford (2018)\n\n#### 1. Facts of the Case\nThe case involves a challenge to Wisconsin's 2011 state legislative redistricting plan, known as Act 43, which was enacted by a Republican-controlled legislature and signed into law by a Republican governor. Twelve Democratic voters alleged that Act 43 was a partisan gerrymander designed to disadvantage Democratic voters by \"cracking\" and \"packing\" them into districts. The plaintiffs claimed that this gerrymandering violated their First Amendment right of association and their Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection. The case was heard by a three-judge District Court, which ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, finding Act 43 unconstitutional. The defendants, members of the state election commission, appealed directly to the Supreme Court.\n\n#### 2. Legal Question(s)\nThe Supreme Court addressed the question of whether the plaintiffs had standing to challenge Act 43. Specifically, the Court considered whether the plaintiffs had suffered a particularized injury due to the alleged partisan gerrymandering and whether their claimed harm was sufficiently concrete and individualized to satisfy Article III standing requirements.\n\n#### 3. Conclusion/Holding\nThe Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate Article III standing because they did not prove that they suffered a particularized injury. The Court ruled that to establish standing in a partisan gerrymandering case based on vote dilution, a plaintiff must show that their individual vote was diluted due to being \"cracked\" or \"packed\" in their specific district. The Court found that while four plaintiffs alleged such particularized burdens in their complaint, they failed to pursue these allegations at trial and instead relied on a theory of statewide injury. The Court vacated the District Court's judgment and remanded the case, giving the plaintiffs an opportunity to prove concrete and particularized injuries. The Court's decision emphasizes that a plaintiff's remedy must be tailored to redress their particular injury, and it leaves open the possibility of considering other theories of harm and justiciability in future cases.\n\n## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:\n   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?\n   - **Severity Assessment**:\n     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**\n     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**\n     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**\n\n2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:\n   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**\n   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**\n\n3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:\n   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**\n   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**\n\n## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):\nScore based on the *worst* error found.
