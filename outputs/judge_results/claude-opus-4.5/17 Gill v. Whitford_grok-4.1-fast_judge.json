Your job is to find ANY and ALL errors in AI-generated Supreme Court case summaries.\n\nCompare the GENERATED SUMMARY against the REFERENCE SUMMARY (ground truth).\n\n## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):\nFacts of the case\n\nIn 2010, for the first time in over forty years, Wisconsin voters elected a Republican majority in the state assembly and the senate, and a Republican governor. As a result, the Republican leadership developed a voting district map that its drafters calculated would allow Republicans to maintain a majority under any likely voting scenario. The redistricting plan was introduced in July 2011, and both the senate and the assembly passed the bill shortly thereafter. The governor signed the bill into law in August 2011. Even before it was enacted, the plan faced two legal challenges, on constitutional and statutory grounds. A federal court upheld the plan as not violating the \"one person one vote\" principle nor violating the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nPlaintiffs in this case challenge the plan as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. At issue is whether the plan systematically dilutes the voting strength of Democratic voters statewide.\n\nQuestion\n1. Did the district court err in holding that it had the authority to hear a statewide challenge to Wisconsin's redistricting plan, rather than requiring a district-by-district analysis?\n2. Did the district court err in holding that the redistricting plan was an unconstitutional gerrymander?\n3. Did the district court use an incorrect test for a gerrymander?\n4. Are defendants entitled to present evidence that they would have prevailed under the gerrymander test actually used by the district court?\n5. Are partisan gerrymandering claims justiciable?\n\nConclusion\nThe plaintiffs failed to demonstrate Article III standing, so there is no need to resolve any of the questions presented. In a unanimous decision authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Court sidestepped (for now) all of the key issues regarding partisan gerrymandering, resolving the case instead on the technical issue of judicial standing. For a plaintiff to bring a case in federal court, she must have Article III standing, which requires showing three elements, one of which is \"injury in fact.\" To show injury in fact, a plaintiff must show that she has suffered \"invasion of a legally protected interest\" that is \"concrete and particularized.\" In this case, the Court found that the plaintiffs alleged but did not prove individual harms, providing evidence instead only of statewide harms of alleged partisan gerrymandering. The Court thus vacated the judgment of the district court and remanded for further proceedings.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, in which Justice Neil Gorsuch joined. Justices Thomas and Gorsuch did not join the majority with respect to the decision to remand the case and allow the plaintiffs a second chance to prove standing and thus wrote separately to express this disagreement with the disposition.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan filed a concurring opinion in which Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, and Sonia Sotomayor joined. Justice Kagan agreed with the findings and conclusions of the Court but wrote separately, in essence, to describe how the plaintiffs might proceed upon remand. Justice Kagan suggests that the plaintiffs might present more than simply a vote dilution theory, but also an infringement of their First Amendment right of association. Such a claim, according to Justice Kagan, would not require the plaintiffs to show injury-in-fact in the form of injury to her particular voting district because that claim would be statewide in nature. She predicts that partisan gerrymandering \"injures enough individuals and organizations in enough concrete ways . . . that standing requirements, properly applied, will not often or long prevent courts from reaching the merits of cases like this one.\"\n\n\n## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):\n### 1. Facts of the Case\nWisconsin elects members of its State Legislature from single-member districts, with the legislature required by the Wisconsin Constitution to redraw district boundaries following each census. After the 2010 census, a Republican-controlled legislature passed, and a Republican governor signed, a new districting plan known as Act 43 (Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 4.009, 4.01\u20134.99; 2011 Wis. Laws ch. 4). Under Act 43, Republicans won majorities in the State Assembly in the 2012 election (60 seats with 48.6% of the two-party statewide vote) and the 2014 election (63 seats with 52% of the statewide vote).\n\nIn July 2015, twelve Democratic voters, including lead plaintiff William Whitford (a resident of heavily Democratic Assembly District 76), filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin against several members of the state election commission (appellants Beverly R. Gill et al.). The plaintiffs (appellees William Whitford et al.) alleged that Act 43 constituted an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander that harmed the Democratic Party's ability to translate votes into legislative seats through \"cracking\" (dividing Democratic voters among districts where they fail to achieve majorities) and \"packing\" (concentrating Democratic voters into a few districts won by large margins). They claimed this violated their First Amendment right of association and Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection, as measured by an \"efficiency gap\" metric comparing each party's \"wasted votes\" (votes for losing candidates or excess votes for winning candidates beyond what is needed to win) across all districts. Four plaintiffs\u2014Mary Lynne Donohue (District 26), Wendy Sue Johnson, Janet Mitchell, and Jerome Wallace\u2014specifically alleged packing or cracking in their own districts.\n\nThe defendants moved to dismiss for lack of standing, arguing that individual voters' interests are limited to their own districts. A three-judge District Court denied the motion (Whitford v. Nichol, 151 F. Supp. 3d 918 (WD Wis. 2015)), held a trial, and ruled Act 43 unconstitutional under a three-part test: (1) intent to impede effectiveness of votes based on political affiliation; (2) that effect; and (3) no legitimate justification (218 F. Supp. 3d 837 (WD Wis. 2016)). The court found a cognizable statewide equal protection injury to Democratic voters, enjoined Act 43's use, and ordered a remedial plan by November 1, 2017. The defendants appealed directly to the Supreme Court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71253, which stayed the judgment (582 U.S. ___ (2017)).\n\n### 2. Legal Question(s)\nThe Court addressed whether the plaintiffs demonstrated Article III standing to challenge the statewide constitutionality of Act 43, specifically whether they showed a particularized \"injury in fact\"\u2014an invasion of a legally protected interest that is concrete and particularized, affecting them in a personal and individual way (Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560, and n. 1 (1992))\u2014arising from alleged vote dilution via partisan gerrymandering. The Court considered whether the alleged statewide harm to Democrats (measured by efficiency gap and partisan asymmetry) or to collective representation constituted such an injury, or whether any injury was district-specific, and distinguished prior cases on malapportionment (Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962); Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964)) and racial gerrymandering (United States v. Hays, 515 U.S. 737 (1995); Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, 575 U.S. ___ (2015)). The Court did not reach the justiciability of partisan gerrymandering claims or the merits.\n\n### 3. Conclusion/Holding\nThe Supreme Court held unanimously that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate Article III standing and vacated the District Court's judgment (218 F. Supp. 3d 837), remanding for further proceedings rather than directing dismissal, given the unsettled nature of partisan gerrymandering claims.\n\nChief Justice Roberts's opinion (joined by Kennedy, Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito, Sotomayor, and Kagan JJ.; Thomas and Gorsuch JJ. joined except Part III) reasoned that partisan gerrymandering injury, if any, from vote dilution is district-specific because a voter resides in and votes in only one district, where boundaries and voter composition determine packing or cracking; a voter outside a gerrymandered district asserts only a generalized grievance (Hays, 515 U.S. at 745). Statewide claims analogized to malapportionment cases (Baker; Reynolds) fail because those injuries were individual (unequal vote weight), remedied district-by-district, not statewide group harm to party fortunes or legislative composition, which is a nonjusticiable generalized grievance (Lance v. Coffman, 549 U.S. 437 (2007); Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 357 (1996)). Four plaintiffs alleged but did not prove district-specific harm at trial; evidence offered\u2014Whitford's testimony on desiring a Democratic majority; mapmakers' partisan deliberations (e.g., \"S curves\"); and efficiency gap/partisan asymmetry studies\u2014measured group/party effects, not individual vote burdens, and thus insufficient for standing (Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 560).\n\nThe Court set no binding precedent on justiciability or merits of partisan gerrymandering but reaffirmed that standing requires proof of concrete, particularized, district-specific injury for vote dilution claims (distinguishing Gaffney v. Cummings, 412 U.S. 735 (1973); Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U.S. 109 (1986); Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U.S. 267 (2004); League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399 (2006)); remedies must be tailored to proven injury; and left open other theories (e.g., associational harm). Justice Kagan (joined by Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor JJ.) concurred, elaborating standing proof for vote dilution (e.g., alternative maps) and associational claims. Justice Thomas (joined by Gorsuch J.) concurred in part, advocating remand with dismissal instructions.\n\n## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:\n   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?\n   - **Severity Assessment**:\n     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**\n     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**\n     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**\n\n2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:\n   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**\n   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**\n\n3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:\n   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**\n   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**\n\n## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):\nScore based on the *worst* error found.
