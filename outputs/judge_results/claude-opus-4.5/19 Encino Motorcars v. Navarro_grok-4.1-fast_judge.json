It correctly captures the main holding (service advisors are exempt from FLSA overtime requirements), the 5-4 decision split, the reasoning about statutory interpretation, rejection of the distributive canon, rejection of narrow construction principle, and the dissent by Justice Ginsburg joined by Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan. The summary adds specific citations and details (like case citations, CFR references, and California location) that are not in the reference but appear to be accurate supplementary information rather than hallucinations that change the legal meaning.

  "_prompt_used": "You are a highly critical, pedantic legal scholar auditor. Your job is to find ANY and ALL errors in AI-generated Supreme Court case summaries.\n\nCompare the GENERATED SUMMARY against the REFERENCE SUMMARY (ground truth).\n\n## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):\nFacts of the case\n\nEncino Motorcars, LLC, which sells and services Mercedes-Benz cars, employed Hector Navarro and others as \"service advisors.\" Their role was to greet car owners upon arrival in the service area of the dealership, listen to customers' concerns about their cars, evaluate the repair and maintenance needs of the cars, suggest services, write up estimates, and follow up with the customer while repair work was being done.\n\nNavarro and the other plaintiffs alleged in federal district court that Encino Motorcars violated the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) by failing to pay them overtime wages. The district court dismissed the claim, finding that the FLSA exempts service advisors from its overtime compensation provisions. A panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed, using the principle of Chevron deference to rely on a regulation promulgated by the Department of Labor in 2011 interpreting the statutory exemption as not encompassing service providers. The US Supreme Court vacated the panel's decision, holding that the regulation lacked sufficient explanation and thus was not entitled to deference. On remand, the Ninth Circuit formulated its own interpretation of the applicable FLSA provision and concluded that the exemption does not encompass service advisors.\n\nQuestion\nAre service advisors at car dealerships exempt under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(10)(A) from the Fair Labor Standards Act's overtime-pay requirements?\n\nConclusion\nIn a 5-4 decision, the Court reversed and remanded the case back to the Ninth Circuit, holding that because service advisors at car dealerships are \"salesm[e]n . . . primarily engaged in . . . servicing automobiles,\" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(10)(A), they are exempt from the FLSA's overtime-pay requirements.\n\nConstruing the relevant portions of the statute, the Court explained that a service advisor is clearly a \"salesman\" who sells services to customers for their vehicles. The Court also concluded that service advisors are \"primarily engaged in . . . servicing automobiles\" since they are integral in the process of providing maintenance and repair services to customers, even if they do not spend most of their time physically repairing vehicles. The Court rejected the Ninth Circuit's use of the distributive canon, as well as its conclusion that FLSA exemptions should be construed narrowly in holding that service advisors were not exempt. It also rejected the appellate court's reliance on a 1966-67 DOL Occupational Outlook Handbook and the FLSA legislative history, both of which the Court found unpersuasive.\n\nJustice Ginsburg filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan joined.\n\n\n## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):\n### 1. Facts of the Case\nEncino Motorcars, LLC, a Mercedes-Benz dealership in California (petitioner), employed Hector Navarro et al. (respondents), current and former service advisors. Service advisors interact with customers, sell them services for their vehicles, meet customers, listen to concerns, suggest repair and maintenance services, sell new accessories or replacement parts, record service orders, follow up as services are performed, and explain repair work upon vehicle return. In 2012, respondents sued petitioner in the District Court for backpay, alleging violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7207(a), by failing to pay overtime, claiming they were not exempt under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7213(b)(10)(A). Petitioner moved to dismiss, arguing exemption. The District Court agreed and dismissed. The Ninth Circuit reversed, deferring under Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), to a 2011 Department of Labor (DOL) rule, 76 Fed. Reg. 18832 (codified at 29 CFR \u00a7779.372(c)), interpreting \"salesman\" to exclude service advisors; see Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 780 F.3d 1267 (2015). The Supreme Court vacated and remanded in Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro (Encino I), 579 U.S. ___ (2016), holding no deference due to the 2011 rule's procedural defect but not deciding exemption coverage. On remand, the Ninth Circuit again reversed, holding service advisors not exempt; 845 F.3d 925 (2017). The Supreme Court granted certiorari, 582 U.S. ___ (2017).\n\n### 2. Legal Question(s)\nWhether service advisors at car dealerships are exempt from the FLSA's overtime-pay requirement under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7213(b)(10)(A), which exempts \"any salesman, partsman, or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or servicing automobiles, trucks, or farm implements, if he is employed by a nonmanufacturing establishment primarily engaged in the business of selling such vehicles or implements to ultimate purchasers.\" The parties agreed petitioner qualified as such an establishment, respondents were not partsmen or mechanics, and respondents were not primarily engaged in selling automobiles.\n\n### 3. Conclusion/Holding\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit and held that service advisors are exempt under \u00a7213(b)(10)(A) as \"salesm[e]n . . . primarily engaged in . . . servicing automobiles.\" Justice Thomas delivered the opinion for the Court, joined by Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Kennedy, Justice Alito, and Justice Gorsuch; Justice Ginsburg dissented, joined by Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan.\n\nReasoning: (a) \"Salesman\" has its ordinary meaning as someone who sells goods or services (14 Oxford English Dictionary 391 (2d ed. 1989); Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1262 (1966)), and service advisors sell customers services for their vehicles. (b) Service advisors are \"primarily engaged in . . . servicing automobiles,\" as \"servicing\" means \"the action of maintaining or repairing a motor vehicle\" or \"the action of providing a service\" (15 Oxford English Dictionary 39); they are integral to the process, like partsmen (who do not physically repair vehicles but obtain and provide parts; 1 Dept. of Labor, Dictionary of Occupational Titles 33 (3d ed. 1965)). (c) The Ninth Circuit's distributive canon (matching \"salesman\" with \"selling\" and \"partsman/mechanic\" with \"servicing\") fails because \"or\" connecting nouns and gerunds is disjunctive (United States v. Woods, 571 U.S. 31, 45 (2013)); context favors this: no one-to-one matching of three nouns with two gerunds; disjunctive reading linguistically possible and apt for service advisors; exemption's breadth (\"any,\" three \"or\"s) supports any combination (Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.S. 214, 219 (2008); Brown v. Gardner, 513 U.S. 115, 118 (1994)). (d) FLSA exemptions receive a fair reading, not narrow construction, absent textual indication otherwise. (e) DOL's 1966\u20131967 Occupational Outlook Handbook and FLSA legislative history (silence on service advisors) are unpersuasive; text controls (Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 495, n.13 (1985)).\n\nPrecedent set: Service advisors are exempt from FLSA overtime; exemptions interpreted by fair reading of text, not narrow construction; no deference to procedurally defective agency rules (Encino I); reversed and remanded, 584 U.S. ___ (2018).\n\n## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:\n   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?\n   - **Severity Assessment**:\n     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**\n     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**\n     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**\n\n2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:\n   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**\n   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**\n\n3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:\n   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**\n   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**\n\n## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):\nScore based on the *worst* error found.
