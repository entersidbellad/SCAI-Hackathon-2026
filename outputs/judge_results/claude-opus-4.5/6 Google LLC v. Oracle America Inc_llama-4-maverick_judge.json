Your job is to find ANY and ALL errors in AI-generated Supreme Court case summaries.\n\nCompare the GENERATED SUMMARY against the REFERENCE SUMMARY (ground truth).\n\n## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):\nFacts of the case\n\nWhen Google implemented its Android Operating System (Android OS), it wrote its own programming language based on Java, which is owned by Oracle. To facilitate developers writing their own programs for Android OS, Google's version used the same names, organization, and functionality as Java's Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).\n\nOracle sued Google for copyright infringement, but the federal district judge held that APIs are not subject to copyright because permitting a private entity to own the copyright to a programming language would stifle innovation and collaboration, contrary to the goals of copyright. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the lower court, finding that the Java APIs are copyrightable but leaving open the possibility of a fair use defense. The U.S. Supreme Court denied Google's petition for certiorari.\n\nUpon remand to the district court, a jury found that Google's use of the Java API was fair use. Oracle appealed, and the Federal Circuit again reversed the lower court. The Federal Circuit held that Google's use was not fair as a matter of law.\n\nQuestion\n1. Does copyright protection extend to a software interface? \n2. If so, does the petitioner's use of a software interface in the context of creating a new computer program constitute fair use?\n\nConclusion\nAssuming a software interface may be subject to copyright protection, Google's limited copying of the Java SE Application Programming Interface constituted a fair use of that material under copyright law. Justice Stephen Breyer authored the 6-2 majority opinion.\n\nCopyright law aims to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by simultaneously granting creators exclusive copyrights and limiting the scope of such rights through the fair use doctrine. To decide no more than necessary to resolve the case, the Court assumed that software code is subject to copyright protection.\n\nCourts consider four statutory factors in evaluating whether a secondary use is fair. First, Google's use of the Java APIs is transformative. Google copied only what was necessary to allow programmers to work in a different computing environment but with a familiar programming language. Second, the copied lines are \"inherently bound together with uncopyrightable ideas,\" suggesting that the application of fair use to this context is unlikely to undermine the general copyright protection that Congress provided for computer programs. Third, Google copied only .4% of the entire API, weighing in favor of fair use. Finally, the record shows that Google's new smartphone platform is not a market substitute for Java SE. Because all four factors support a finding of fair use, Google's limited copying constituted fair use.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas authored a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Samuel Alito joined, arguing that the Court should have addressed the question whether Oracle's code is copyrightable. Justice Thomas would have concluded that it is, and then he would have found that Google's use of that copyrighted code was not fair. By copying Oracle's code, Google \"erased 97.5% of the value of Oracle's partnership with Amazon, made tens of billions of dollars, and established its position as the owner of the largest mobile operating system in the world.\"\n\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.\n\n\n## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):\n### Summary of Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc.\n\n#### 1. Facts of the Case\nGoogle acquired Android, Inc. in 2005 and sought to develop a software platform for mobile devices. To attract programmers familiar with the Java programming language, Google copied approximately 11,500 lines of code from Oracle's Java SE program, which is part of an Application Programming Interface (API). Oracle sued Google for copyright infringement. The lower courts considered whether the copied lines were copyrightable and whether Google's copying constituted fair use. The Federal Circuit held that the copied lines were copyrightable, and after a jury found for Google on fair use, the Federal Circuit reversed, concluding that Google's copying was not fair use as a matter of law.\n\n#### 2. Legal Question(s)\nThe Supreme Court addressed whether Google's copying of the Java SE API constituted fair use under the Copyright Act. Specifically, the Court examined the four statutory factors for determining fair use: (1) the purpose and character of the use, (2) the nature of the copyrighted work, (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used, and (4) the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.\n\n#### 3. Conclusion/Holding\nThe Supreme Court held that Google's copying of the Java SE API was a fair use as a matter of law. The Court assumed, without deciding, that the API was copyrightable and focused on the fair use analysis. The Court concluded that Google's use was transformative because it allowed programmers to work in a new computing environment (smartphones) without having to learn a new programming system. The Court also found that the nature of the copyrighted work (the API) favored fair use because it was inherently bound with uncopyrightable ideas and was designed to be used by programmers. The amount copied was considered substantial in absolute terms but small relative to the entire Java SE program. The Court determined that the fourth factor (market effects) also favored fair use because Google's Android platform was not a market substitute for Java SE, and enforcing Oracle's copyright could harm the public by limiting future creativity.\n\nThe Court's reasoning emphasized the importance of fair use in promoting creativity and innovation, particularly in the context of computer programs. The decision reversed the Federal Circuit's judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings. Justice Thomas dissented, arguing that the declaring code was copyrightable and that Google's use was not fair.\n\n## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:\n   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?\n   - **Severity Assessment**:\n     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**\n     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**\n     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**\n\n2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:\n   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**\n   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**\n\n3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:\n   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**\n   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**\n\n## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):\nScore based on the *worst* error found.
