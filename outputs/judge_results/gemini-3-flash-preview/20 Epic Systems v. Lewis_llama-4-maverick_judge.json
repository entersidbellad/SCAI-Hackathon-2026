Your job is to find ANY and ALL errors in AI-generated Supreme Court case summaries.\n\nCompare the GENERATED SUMMARY against the REFERENCE SUMMARY (ground truth).\n\n## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):\nFacts of the case\n\nEpic Systems Corporation (Epic) is a Wisconsin-based healthcare data management software company. Epic has an arbitration agreement that requires its employees to resolve any employment-based disputes with Epic through individual arbitration and to waive their right to participate in or receive benefit from any class, collective, or representative proceedings. In February 2015, former Epic employee Jacob Lewis sued Epic in federal court individually and on behalf of similarly-situated employees and claimed that they had been denied overtime wages in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Epic moved to dismiss the complaint and cited the waiver clause of its arbitration agreement. The district court denied Epic's motion and held that the waiver was unenforceable because it violated the right of employees to engage in \"concerted activities\" under Section Seven of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the lower court's decision and added that the waiver was also unenforceable under the savings clause of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). That clause provides that arbitration agreements are to be enforced unless there legal or equitable grounds that would render a contract unenforceable. Finding the waiver of collective proceedings illegal under the NLRA, the appellate court held that the arbitration agreement was unenforceable under the FAA. This case was consolidated with Ernst & Young v. Morris and National Labor Relations Board v. Murphy Oil USA, Inc., both cases that dealt with the relationship between the FAA and the NLRA.\n\nQuestion\nDoes the National Labor Relations Act prohibit enforcement of an agreement requiring employees to resolve disputes with the employer through individual arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act?\n\nConclusion\nThe Court held that neither the Arbitration Act's saving clause nor the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) supersede Congress's instructions in the Federal Arbitration Act that arbitration agreements providing for individualized proceedings must be enforced. Justice Neil Gorsuch delivered the opinion for a 5-4 majority. The majority found that the Federal Arbitration Act \"instructed federal courts to enforce arbitration agreements according to their terms\" and that the NLRA \"does not mention class or collection action procedures\" and thus cannot be read to displace the Arbitration Act.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion to add that \"the employees also cannot prevail under the plain meaning of the Federal Arbitration Act.\"\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan joined. The dissent noted the extreme imbalance between employer and employee and Congress's attempt to remedy that imbalance in passing the NLRA and its forerunner, the Norris-LaGuardia Act. In this context, the dissent found that the Federal Arbitration Act should not shrink the NLRA's \"protective sphere.\"\n\n\n## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):\n### 1. Facts of the Case\n\nThe cases before the Supreme Court involve employees who entered into arbitration agreements with their employers, requiring individualized arbitration proceedings to resolve employment disputes. Despite these agreements, the employees sought to litigate Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and related state law claims through class or collective actions in federal court. The employers countered with motions to compel arbitration based on the agreements. The employees argued that the arbitration agreements violated the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) by barring class or collective actions, which they claimed were \"concerted activities\" protected under \u00a77 of the NLRA. The courts of appeals were divided on whether the NLRA rendered such arbitration agreements unenforceable, leading to the Supreme Court granting certiorari to resolve the conflict.\n\n### 2. Legal Question(s)\n\nThe specific legal questions addressed by the Court were:\n1. Whether the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) requires enforcement of arbitration agreements that mandate individualized proceedings.\n2. Whether the NLRA overrides the FAA by protecting employees' rights to engage in class or collective actions.\n\n### 3. Conclusion/Holding\n\nThe Supreme Court held that the FAA requires enforcement of arbitration agreements according to their terms, including those that specify individualized proceedings. The Court found that the NLRA does not conflict with the FAA on this matter because \u00a77 of the NLRA, which protects \"concerted activities,\" does not clearly and manifestly intend to displace the FAA or guarantee a right to class or collective actions. The Court applied the principle of statutory construction that favors giving effect to both statutes where possible and held that the NLRA and FAA can coexist without conflict. The Court's reasoning was based on the text, structure, and history of the NLRA, as well as relevant precedent. The decision effectively means that employers can enforce arbitration agreements that bar class or collective actions, limiting employees to individualized arbitration for resolving certain employment disputes.\n\nThe Court's ruling was 5-4, with Justice Gorsuch delivering the majority opinion joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito. Justice Thomas also filed a concurring opinion, and Justice Ginsburg filed a dissenting opinion joined by Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan.\n\n## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:\n   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?\n   - **Severity Assessment**:\n     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**\n     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**\n     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**\n\n2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:\n   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**\n   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**\n\n3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:\n   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**\n   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**\n\n## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):\nScore based on the *worst* error found.
