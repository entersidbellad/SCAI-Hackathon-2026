Your job is to find ANY and ALL errors in AI-generated Supreme Court case summaries.\n\nCompare the GENERATED SUMMARY against the REFERENCE SUMMARY (ground truth).\n\n## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):\nFacts of the case\n\nIn 2014, Roxanne Torres was involved in an incident with police officers in which she was operating a vehicle under the influence of methamphetamine and in the process of trying to get away, endangered the two officers pursuing her. In the process, one of the officers shot and injured her. Torres pleaded no contest to three crimes: (1) aggravated fleeing from a law enforcement officer, (2) assault on a police officer, and (3) unlawfully taking a motor vehicle.\n\nIn October 2016, she filed a civil-rights complaint in federal court against the two officers, alleging claims including excessive force and conspiracy to engage in excessive force. Construing Torres's complaint as asserting the excessive-force claims under the Fourth Amendment, the court concluded that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity. In the court's view, the officers had not seized Torres at the time of the shooting, and without a seizure, there could be no Fourth Amendment violation. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed.\n\nQuestion\nMust physical force used to detain a suspect be successful to constitute a \"seizure\" under the Fourth Amendment?\n\nConclusion\nThe application of physical force to the body of a person with intent to restrain is a seizure, even if the force does not succeed in subduing the person. Chief Justice John Roberts authored the majority opinion.\n\nUnder the Court's precedents, common law arrests are considered seizures under the Fourth Amendment, and the application of force to the body of a person with intent to restrain constitutes an arrest even if the arrestee escapes. The use of a device, here, a gun, to effect the arrest, makes no difference in the outcome; it is still a seizure. There is no reason to draw an \"artificial line\" between grasping an arrestee with a hand and using some other means of applying physical force to effect an arrest. The key consideration is whether the conduct objectively manifests the intent to restrain; subjective perceptions are irrelevant. Additionally, the requirement of intent to restrain lasts only as long as the application of force. In this case, the officers' conduct clearly manifested intent to restrain Torres and was thus a seizure under the Fourth Amendment.\n\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch authored a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito joined, arguing that \"neither the Constitution nor common sense\" support the majority's definition of a seizure.\n\n\n## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):\n### Summary of Torres v. Madrid\n\n#### 1. Facts of the Case\nThe case involves petitioner Roxanne Torres, who was shot by New Mexico State Police Officers Janice Madrid and Richard Williamson. The officers arrived at an Albuquerque apartment complex to execute an arrest warrant for a different individual. Torres, who was experiencing methamphetamine withdrawal, got into her car and attempted to escape, believing the officers were carjackers. The officers fired 13 shots, striking Torres twice. She managed to escape, drove 75 miles to a hospital, and was later arrested the next day upon being airlifted back to Albuquerque. Torres sought damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983, claiming the officers used excessive force and that the shooting constituted an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment.\n\n#### 2. Legal Question(s)\nThe specific legal question addressed by the Court was whether the application of physical force to a person's body with the intent to restrain constitutes a seizure under the Fourth Amendment, even if the person does not submit to the authority or is not subdued.\n\n#### 3. Conclusion/Holding\nThe Supreme Court held that the application of physical force to the body of a person with the intent to restrain is a seizure, even if the person does not submit and is not subdued. The Court's reasoning was based on the common law of arrest, which considered the slightest touching or application of physical force to be an arrest. The Court rejected the argument that a seizure requires actual control or submission, holding that the use of force with intent to restrain is sufficient. The Court's decision vacated the Tenth Circuit's judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings to address the reasonableness of the seizure, damages, and the officers' entitlement to qualified immunity. The majority opinion, delivered by Chief Justice Roberts, was joined by Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan, and Kavanaugh, while Justice Gorsuch dissented, joined by Justices Thomas and Alito. Justice Barrett took no part in the decision.\n\n## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:\n   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?\n   - **Severity Assessment**:\n     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**\n     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**\n     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**\n\n2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:\n   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**\n   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**\n\n3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:\n   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**\n   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**\n\n## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):\nScore based on the *worst* error found.
