Your job is to find ANY and ALL errors in AI-generated Supreme Court case summaries.\n\nCompare the GENERATED SUMMARY against the REFERENCE SUMMARY (ground truth).\n\n## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):\nFacts of the case\n\nEncino Motorcars, LLC, which sells and services Mercedes-Benz cars, employed Hector Navarro and others as \"service advisors.\" Their role was to greet car owners upon arrival in the service area of the dealership, listen to customers' concerns about their cars, evaluate the repair and maintenance needs of the cars, suggest services, write up estimates, and follow up with the customer while repair work was being done.\n\nNavarro and the other plaintiffs alleged in federal district court that Encino Motorcars violated the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) by failing to pay them overtime wages. The district court dismissed the claim, finding that the FLSA exempts service advisors from its overtime compensation provisions. A panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed, using the principle of Chevron deference to rely on a regulation promulgated by the Department of Labor in 2011 interpreting the statutory exemption as not encompassing service providers. The US Supreme Court vacated the panel's decision, holding that the regulation lacked sufficient explanation and thus was not entitled to deference. On remand, the Ninth Circuit formulated its own interpretation of the applicable FLSA provision and concluded that the exemption does not encompass service advisors.\n\nQuestion\nAre service advisors at car dealerships exempt under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(10)(A) from the Fair Labor Standards Act's overtime-pay requirements?\n\nConclusion\nIn a 5-4 decision, the Court reversed and remanded the case back to the Ninth Circuit, holding that because service advisors at car dealerships are \"salesm[e]n . . . primarily engaged in . . . servicing automobiles,\" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(10)(A), they are exempt from the FLSA's overtime-pay requirements.\n\nConstruing the relevant portions of the statute, the Court explained that a service advisor is clearly a \"salesman\" who sells services to customers for their vehicles. The Court also concluded that service advisors are \"primarily engaged in . . . servicing automobiles\" since they are integral in the process of providing maintenance and repair services to customers, even if they do not spend most of their time physically repairing vehicles. The Court rejected the Ninth Circuit's use of the distributive canon, as well as its conclusion that FLSA exemptions should be construed narrowly in holding that service advisors were not exempt. It also rejected the appellate court's reliance on a 1966-67 DOL Occupational Outlook Handbook and the FLSA legislative history, both of which the Court found unpersuasive.\n\nJustice Ginsburg filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan joined.\n\n\n## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):\nHere is a summary of the Supreme Court's opinion in *Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro et al.*:\n\n**1. Facts of the Case**\n\nRespondents, who were current and former service advisors for petitioner Encino Motorcars, LLC, filed a lawsuit alleging that Encino Motorcars violated the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) by failing to pay them overtime wages. Encino Motorcars moved to dismiss the suit, arguing that service advisors are exempt from the FLSA's overtime pay requirement under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7213(b)(10)(A). This exemption applies to \"any salesman, partsman, or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or servicing automobiles, trucks, or farm implements.\" The District Court dismissed the suit, agreeing with Encino Motorcars.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, finding the statute ambiguous and the legislative history inconclusive. It deferred to a 2011 Department of Labor rule that interpreted \"salesman\" to exclude service advisors. The Supreme Court vacated the Ninth Circuit's judgment in *Encino I*, holding that courts could not defer to the procedurally defective 2011 rule, but it did not decide whether the exemption actually covered service advisors. The case was remanded to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nOn remand, the Ninth Circuit again ruled that the exemption does not include service advisors. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review this decision.\n\n**2. Legal Question(s)**\n\nThe primary legal question before the Supreme Court was whether service advisors at automobile dealerships are considered \"salesmen . . . primarily engaged in . . . servicing automobiles\" and are therefore exempt from the overtime pay requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7213(b)(10)(A).\n\n**3. Conclusion/Holding**\n\nThe Supreme Court held that service advisors are indeed \"salesmen . . . primarily engaged in . . . servicing automobiles\" and are thus exempt from the FLSA's overtime-pay requirement.\n\nThe Court reasoned as follows:\n*   **\"Salesman\"**: The ordinary meaning of \"salesman\" is someone who sells goods or services. Service advisors sell services for vehicles to customers, fitting this definition.\n*   **\"Primarily engaged in . . . servicing automobiles\"**: The term \"servicing\" can mean either maintaining or repairing a vehicle, or providing a service. Service advisors are integral to the servicing process, as they meet customers, listen to concerns, suggest services, sell accessories or parts, record orders, follow up, and explain work. The Court noted that partsmen, who are agreed to be exempt, also do not spend most of their time physically repairing cars but are considered integral to servicing.\n*   **Statutory Interpretation**: The Court rejected the Ninth Circuit's reliance on the distributive canon, which would have matched \"salesman\" with \"selling\" and \"partsman\" or \"mechanic\" with \"servicing.\" The Court emphasized that the word \"or\" in the statute is disjunctive, meaning the exemption covers a salesman primarily engaged in either selling *or* servicing. The Court found that the statutory context, including the use of \"any\" and multiple instances of \"or,\" indicated a broad exemption, and that a \"salesman . . . primarily engaged in . . . servicing automobiles\" is an apt description of a service advisor.\n*   **Narrow Construction of Exemptions**: The Court rejected the principle that FLSA exemptions should be construed narrowly, stating that exemptions should be given a \"fair reading\" unless the statute provides a textual indication otherwise. The Court reasoned that exemptions are as much a part of the FLSA's purpose as its remedial provisions.\n*   **Extraneous Sources**: The Court found the Ninth Circuit's reliance on the Occupational Outlook Handbook and legislative history unpersuasive. The Handbook did not dictate the scope of the exemption, and silence in the legislative history cannot override a clear reading of the statutory text.\n\nThe Court reversed the judgment of the Ninth Circuit and remanded the case for further proceedings.\n\n## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:\n   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?\n   - **Severity Assessment**:\n     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**\n     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**\n     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**\n\n2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:\n   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**\n   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**\n\n3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:\n   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**\n   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**\n\n## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):\nScore based on the *worst* error found.
