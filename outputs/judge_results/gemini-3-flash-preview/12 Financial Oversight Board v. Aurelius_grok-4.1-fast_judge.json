Your job is to find ANY and ALL errors in AI-generated Supreme Court case summaries.\n\nCompare the GENERATED SUMMARY against the REFERENCE SUMMARY (ground truth).\n\n## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):\nFacts of the case\n\nSince it was ceded to the United States in 1898, Puerto Rico has accumulated substantial debt, in large part due to its ambiguous legal status as a protectorate of the United States and the economically detrimental policies the United States has enacted over the decades. Exacerbated by a series of governmental financial deficits and a recession, Puerto Rico's debt crisis came to a head in 2015, when its governor announced that the Commonwealth was in a \"death spiral\" and was unable to pay its debt. In June 2016, President Barack Obama signed into law the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act of 2016 (PROMESA), which gave him authority to appoint a seven-member Financial Oversight and Management Board that would have control over Puerto Rico's budget and would negotiate the restructuring of its $125 billion indebtedness. President Obama appointed the seven-member board in August 2016 based on lists supplied by Republic and Democratic lawmakers.\n\nA number of creditors and elected officials of Puerto Rico have been dissatisfied with the board and its decisions and brought a lawsuit challenging President Obama's authority to appoint the board members. The challengers alleged that the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution requires that the Senate confirm high-level federal officers and that the board members were within the scope of this Clause. The federal district court in Puerto Rico ruled against the creditors, finding the board is an instrumentality of the Commonwealth government established pursuant to Congress's plenary powers under the Territorial Clause and that the board members are not \"Officers of the United States.\"\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed, concluding that the Territorial Clause does not supersede the application of the Appointments Clause in an unincorporated territory and that the board members are \"Officers of the United States\" because: (1) they occupy \"continuing positions,\" (2) exercise \"significant authority\" that is the same or more than that exercised by other officers the U.S. Supreme Court has found to be \"Officers of the United States,\" and (3) exercise their authority \"pursuant to the laws of the United States.\" Moreover, these officers are \"principal\" officers subject to the Appointments Clause because they are answerable to and removable only by the President and are not directed or supervised by others who were appointed by the President with Senate confirmation.\n\nQuestion\n1. Does the Appointments Clause govern the appointment of members of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico?\n2. Does the de facto officer doctrine allow courts to deny meaningful relief to successful separation-of-powers challengers who are suffering ongoing injury at the hands of unconstitutionally appointed principal officers?\n\nConclusion\nThe Appointments Clause constrains the appointments power as to all officers of the United States, including those who exercise power in or in relation to Puerto Rico, but the Clause does not restrict the appointment or selection of the members of the Financial Oversight and Management Board. Based on this conclusion, the Court had no reason to address the second question presented. Justice Stephen Breyer authored the opinion of the Court that was unanimous in the judgment.\n\nThe Appointments Clause of the federal Constitution is intended to allocate between the President and the Senate responsibility for selecting officers to hold high federal positions. Because of this purpose, the Appointments Clause should apply to all officers of the United States, even those with powers and duties related to Puerto Rico.\n\nHowever, the Appointments Clause does not restrict the appointment of local officers that Congress vests with primarily local duties. When an officer has primarily local duties, he is not an officer of the United States within the meaning of the Appointments Clause. The Board members have primarily local powers and duties, exemplified by the fact that the power of the Board is backed by Puerto Rico law rather than federal law. Indeed, the Board's duty is to oversee the fiscal and budgetary development of Puerto Rico and to initiate bankruptcy proceedings in the interests of Puerto Rico. Consequently, the Appointments Clause does not constrain the appointments power as to the Board members.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas filed an opinion concurring in the judgment but based on interpretation of the \"original public meaning\" of the phrase \"Officers of the United States\" within the Appointments Clause.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor filed an opinion concurring in the judgment to explore issues the Court did not (and did not need) to address regarding the relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States.\n\n\n## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):\n### 1. Facts of the Case\nPuerto Rico faced a fiscal crisis, with public debt rising from $39.2 billion in 2005 to $71 billion in 2016, exacerbated by the expiration of tax advantages in 2006, industry exodus, emigration, and inability to restructure debt under federal bankruptcy law or local statutes invalidated in *Puerto Rico v. Franklin Cal. Tax-Free Trust*, 579 U. S. ___ (2016). In response, Congress enacted the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), 130 Stat. 549, 48 U. S. C. \u00a72101 et seq., pursuant to Article IV, \u00a73, cl. 2, creating the Financial Oversight and Management Board (Board) with seven voting members appointed by the President from lists provided by congressional leaders, without Senate confirmation (\u00a7101(e), 130 Stat. 554\u2013555). The Governor serves ex officio without vote (\u00a7101(b)(e)). On August 31, 2016, President Obama appointed the members, who filed Title III bankruptcy petitions under PROMESA \u00a7\u00a7301\u2013302, 130 Stat. 577, 579, on behalf of the Commonwealth and five entities: Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation (COFINA), Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority, Employees Retirement System, Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, and Puerto Rico Public Buildings Authority (consolidated in *In re Financial Oversight and Management Bd. of Puerto Rico*, No. 17\u2013BK\u20133283 (PR)). After proceedings, creditors including Aurelius Investment, LLC, et al., moved to dismiss, arguing the appointments violated the Appointments Clause, Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2. The District Court denied the motions (*In re Financial Oversight and Management Bd. of Puerto Rico*, 318 F. Supp. 3d 537 (PR 2018)). The First Circuit reversed, holding the appointments unconstitutional but prior actions valid under the de facto officer doctrine (915 F. 3d 838 (2019)). The Board, United States, Aurelius Investment, LLC, et al., Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of All Title III Debtors Other Than COFINA, and Uni\u00f3n de Trabajadores de la Industria El\u00e9ctrica y Riego, Inc. petitioned for certiorari (Nos. 18\u20131334, 18\u20131475, 18\u20131496, 18\u20131514, 18\u20131521), which the Supreme Court granted and consolidated (588 U. S. ___ (2019)).\n\n### 2. Legal Question(s)\nWhether the President's appointment of the seven voting members of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico, without Senate advice and consent as required by the Appointments Clause (Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2), is constitutional, given PROMESA's creation of the Board pursuant to Congress's Article IV, \u00a73, cl. 2 power and its designation of the Board as \"an entity within the territorial government\" not a federal department, agency, establishment, or instrumentality (\u00a7101(c), 130 Stat. 553).\n\n### 3. Conclusion/Holding\nThe Supreme Court reversed the First Circuit (915 F. 3d 838) and remanded. Justice Breyer, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Ginsburg, Alito, Kagan, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh, held that the Appointments Clause applies to all \"Officers of the United States,\" including those exercising power in or related to Puerto Rico, based on the Clause's text, structural allocation of appointment power between President and Senate to ensure accountability, historical practice (e.g., Senate confirmation for territorial Governors with federal duties like those under Acts of Aug. 7, 1789, 1 Stat. 50; June 6, 1900, 31 Stat. 325), and absence of Article IV exception. However, the Clause does not restrict appointment of local officers with primarily local duties created under Article I, \u00a78, cl. 17 or Article IV, \u00a73, cl. 2, as confirmed by text distinguishing federal from nonfederal officers, longstanding practice of filling such offices by election or local appointment (e.g., Northwest Territory under Act of Aug. 7, 1789; Puerto Rico under Foraker Act of 1900, 31 Stat. 77; Jones Act of 1917, 39 Stat. 951; Public Law 600, 64 Stat. 319), and precedents like *O\u2019Donoghue v. United States*, 289 U. S. 516 (1933), and *Palmore v. United States*, 411 U. S. 389 (1973). PROMESA Board members exercise primarily local duties: investigatory powers backed by Puerto Rican law (\u00a7104, 130 Stat. 558\u2013561); oversight of fiscal plans, budgets, laws, and debt issuance for Puerto Rico (\u00a7\u00a7201\u2013207, id., at 563\u2013575); representation of Puerto Rico in Title III bankruptcy (\u00a7\u00a7304, 315, id., at 579, 584); funded by Puerto Rico (\u00a7107, id., at 562). Cases like *Buckley v. Valeo*, 424 U. S. 1 (1976); *Freytag v. Commissioner*, 501 U. S. 868 (1991); and *Lucia v. SEC*, 585 U. S. ___ (2018), do not govern, as they involved indisputably federal duties. Justices Thomas and Sotomayor filed opinions concurring in the judgment. Precedent: Appointments Clause requires Senate confirmation for federal officers but not for local officers with primarily local duties in Territories or D.C., even if created by federal law under Article IV or Article I, \u00a78, cl. 17. Court declined to address de facto officer doctrine (*Ryder v. United States*, 515 U. S. 177 (1995)), Insular Cases (e.g., *Downes v. Bidwell*, 182 U. S. 244 (1901)), Federal Relations Act, or Public Law 600.\n\n## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:\n   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?\n   - **Severity Assessment**:\n     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**\n     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**\n     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**\n\n2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:\n   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**\n   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**\n\n3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:\n   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**\n   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**\n\n## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):\nScore based on the *worst* error found.
