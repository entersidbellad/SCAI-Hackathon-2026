Your job is to find ANY and ALL errors in AI-generated Supreme Court case summaries.\n\nCompare the GENERATED SUMMARY against the REFERENCE SUMMARY (ground truth).\n\n## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):\nFacts of the case\n\nNathan Van Buren was a sergeant with the Cumming, Georgia, Police Department. In that capacity, he came to know a man named Andrew Albo, who allegedly paid young prostitutes to spend time with him and then accused the women of stealing the money he gave them. Van Buren asked Albo for a loan, falsely claiming that he needed over $15,000 to settle his son's medical bills. Unbeknownst to Van Buren, Albo recorded the conversation in which Van Buren requested the loan. Albo presented the recording to a detective in the Forsyth County Sheriff's Office, alleging that Van Buren was \"shaking him down for his money.\" As a result, the FBI conducted a sting operation to test how far Van Buren was willing to go for money. As part of the sting operation, Albo asked Van Buren to look into a woman Albo named, to see whether she was an undercover officer before he would provide Van Buren with the full amount of money Van Buren requested. Van Buren searched the woman's information in a government database maintained by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) and the FBI. The next day, FBI and GBI agents confronted Van Buren, and Van Buren admitted to the fake story about his son to get the loan from Albo, his use of the government database to search for the woman Albo mentioned might be an undercover officer, and that he understood the purpose of searching the database was to discover and reveal to Albo whether the woman was an undercover officer.\n\nA federal grand jury charged Van Buren with one count of honest-services wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1343 and 1346, and one count of felony computer fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030. A jury convicted Van Buren on both counts, and Van Buren appealed his convictions. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit found the jury instructions as to the honest-services count were fatally flawed and remanded that charge for a new trial. It found no deficiencies in the conviction for computer fraud and affirmed that conviction, citing Eleventh Circuit precedent holding that a person with authority to access a computer can be guilty of computer fraud if that person subsequently misuses the computer.\n\nQuestion\nDoes a person who is authorized to access information on a computer for certain purposes violate Section 1030(a)(2) of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act if he accesses that information for an improper purpose?\n\nConclusion\nAn individual \"exceeds authorized access\" under Section 1030(a)(2) of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 when he accesses a computer with authorization and obtains information located in particular areas of the computer that are off-limits to him, not simply when he obtains information available to him with improper motives. Justice Amy Coney Barrett authored the 6-3 majority opinion of the Court.\n\nUnder Section 1030(e)(6), an individual \"exceeds authorized access\" when he \"access[es] a computer with authorization\" and \"use[s] such access to obtain . . . information in the computer that the accesser is not entitled so to obtain.\" The parties in this case agreed that Van Buren was entitled to obtain the license-plate information, but they disagreed that he was \"entitled so to obtain\" it.\" Van Buren argued that the phrase means information one is not allowed to obtain \"by using a computer that he is authorized to access,\" while the government argued that it meant information one was not allowed to obtain \"in the particular manner or circumstances in which he obtained it.\" The Court found Van Buren's interpretation more plausible and natural than the government's, and the statute's structure further supports that interpretation. Moreover, the statutory history\u2014Congress's choice to remove the statute's reference to purpose\u2014lends still further support to Van Buren's reading. Finally, to adopt the government's interpretation \"would attach criminal penalties to a breathtaking amount of commonplace computer activity\" and would inject arbitrariness into the assessment of criminal liability.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas authored a dissenting opinion, which Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito joined, arguing that \"the text, ordinary principles of property law, and statutory history\" support the government's proposed interpretation of the provision.\n\n\n## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):\n### Summary of Supreme Court Opinion in Van Buren v. United States\n\n#### 1. Facts of the Case\nNathan Van Buren, a former Georgia police sergeant, used his patrol-car computer to access a law enforcement database to retrieve information about a particular license plate number in exchange for money. Although Van Buren had valid credentials to access the database, his actions violated department policy against obtaining database information for non-law-enforcement purposes. The access was part of an FBI sting operation. Van Buren was charged and convicted under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) for \"exceeding authorized access\" by accessing the database for an improper purpose.\n\n#### 2. Legal Question(s)\nThe Supreme Court addressed the specific legal question of whether Van Buren \"exceeded authorized access\" under the CFAA by accessing a computer with authorization but using that access to obtain information for an improper purpose. The CFAA defines \"exceeds authorized access\" as accessing a computer \"with authorization and to use such access to obtain or alter information in the computer that the accesser is not entitled so to obtain or alter.\" The key issue was the interpretation of \"entitled so to obtain,\" particularly the meaning of \"so\" and its implications for determining when someone exceeds authorized access.\n\n#### 3. Conclusion/Holding\nThe Supreme Court held that Van Buren did not \"exceed authorized access\" under the CFAA. The Court interpreted \"exceeds authorized access\" to mean accessing a computer with authorization but then obtaining information located in particular areas of the computer to which the accesser lacks access privileges. The Court ruled that the phrase \"is not entitled so to obtain\" refers to information that a person is not allowed to obtain by using a computer they are authorized to access. The Court's reasoning was based on the plain meaning of the statute, the structure of the CFAA, and the implications of different interpretations on common computer activities. The Court reversed the Eleventh Circuit's judgment and remanded the case.\n\nThe Court's decision was based on a detailed analysis of the statutory text, particularly the meaning of \"so\" in the context of \"entitled so to obtain.\" The majority rejected the Government's broader interpretation that would have criminalized a wide range of commonplace computer activities, emphasizing that their interpretation aligns with the specialized meaning of \"access\" in the computing context and the statutory structure. The dissent, however, argued that the majority's interpretation contradicts basic principles of property law and the ordinary meaning of \"exceeds authorized access.\"\n\n## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:\n   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?\n   - **Severity Assessment**:\n     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**\n     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**\n     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**\n\n2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:\n   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**\n   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**\n\n3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:\n   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**\n   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**\n\n## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):\nScore based on the *worst* error found.
