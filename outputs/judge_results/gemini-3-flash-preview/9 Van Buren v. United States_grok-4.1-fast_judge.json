Your job is to find ANY and ALL errors in AI-generated Supreme Court case summaries.\n\nCompare the GENERATED SUMMARY against the REFERENCE SUMMARY (ground truth).\n\n## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):\nFacts of the case\n\nNathan Van Buren was a sergeant with the Cumming, Georgia, Police Department. In that capacity, he came to know a man named Andrew Albo, who allegedly paid young prostitutes to spend time with him and then accused the women of stealing the money he gave them. Van Buren asked Albo for a loan, falsely claiming that he needed over $15,000 to settle his son's medical bills. Unbeknownst to Van Buren, Albo recorded the conversation in which Van Buren requested the loan. Albo presented the recording to a detective in the Forsyth County Sheriff's Office, alleging that Van Buren was \"shaking him down for his money.\" As a result, the FBI conducted a sting operation to test how far Van Buren was willing to go for money. As part of the sting operation, Albo asked Van Buren to look into a woman Albo named, to see whether she was an undercover officer before he would provide Van Buren with the full amount of money Van Buren requested. Van Buren searched the woman's information in a government database maintained by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) and the FBI. The next day, FBI and GBI agents confronted Van Buren, and Van Buren admitted to the fake story about his son to get the loan from Albo, his use of the government database to search for the woman Albo mentioned might be an undercover officer, and that he understood the purpose of searching the database was to discover and reveal to Albo whether the woman was an undercover officer.\n\nA federal grand jury charged Van Buren with one count of honest-services wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1343 and 1346, and one count of felony computer fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030. A jury convicted Van Buren on both counts, and Van Buren appealed his convictions. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit found the jury instructions as to the honest-services count were fatally flawed and remanded that charge for a new trial. It found no deficiencies in the conviction for computer fraud and affirmed that conviction, citing Eleventh Circuit precedent holding that a person with authority to access a computer can be guilty of computer fraud if that person subsequently misuses the computer.\n\nQuestion\nDoes a person who is authorized to access information on a computer for certain purposes violate Section 1030(a)(2) of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act if he accesses that information for an improper purpose?\n\nConclusion\nAn individual \"exceeds authorized access\" under Section 1030(a)(2) of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 when he accesses a computer with authorization and obtains information located in particular areas of the computer that are off-limits to him, not simply when he obtains information available to him with improper motives. Justice Amy Coney Barrett authored the 6-3 majority opinion of the Court.\n\nUnder Section 1030(e)(6), an individual \"exceeds authorized access\" when he \"access[es] a computer with authorization\" and \"use[s] such access to obtain . . . information in the computer that the accesser is not entitled so to obtain.\" The parties in this case agreed that Van Buren was entitled to obtain the license-plate information, but they disagreed that he was \"entitled so to obtain\" it.\" Van Buren argued that the phrase means information one is not allowed to obtain \"by using a computer that he is authorized to access,\" while the government argued that it meant information one was not allowed to obtain \"in the particular manner or circumstances in which he obtained it.\" The Court found Van Buren's interpretation more plausible and natural than the government's, and the statute's structure further supports that interpretation. Moreover, the statutory history\u2014Congress's choice to remove the statute's reference to purpose\u2014lends still further support to Van Buren's reading. Finally, to adopt the government's interpretation \"would attach criminal penalties to a breathtaking amount of commonplace computer activity\" and would inject arbitrariness into the assessment of criminal liability.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas authored a dissenting opinion, which Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito joined, arguing that \"the text, ordinary principles of property law, and statutory history\" support the government's proposed interpretation of the provision.\n\n\n## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):\n### 1. Facts of the Case\nNathan Van Buren, a former police sergeant with the Wrens, Georgia Police Department, developed a relationship with Andrew Albo, whom the deputy chief had warned officers to handle carefully as \"very volatile.\" Van Buren asked Albo for a personal loan, which Albo secretly recorded and reported to the local sheriff's office as a shakedown. The FBI then conducted a sting operation in which Albo asked Van Buren to use the state law enforcement database\u2014accessible via his patrol-car computer\u2014to run a license plate number purportedly belonging to a woman Albo met at a strip club, to check if she was an undercover officer. Albo offered Van Buren approximately $5,000. Van Buren, using his valid credentials, accessed the database (which contained an FBI-created entry) and retrieved the information, violating department policy trained against \"personal use\" or \"improper purpose\" not connected to law enforcement. Van Buren was charged with a felony violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 (CFAA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a71030(a)(2), for intentionally accessing a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access. A jury convicted him, and the District Court sentenced him to 18 months' imprisonment. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, holding that accessing the database for an \"inappropriate reason\" violated the CFAA consistent with circuit precedent, 940 F. 3d 1192 (2019). The Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve a circuit split on the scope of the \"exceeds authorized access\" clause.\n\n### 2. Legal Question(s)\nThe Court addressed whether Van Buren violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a71030(a)(2), which criminalizes intentionally accessing a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access to obtain information, where \"exceeds authorized access\" is defined in \u00a71030(e)(6) as \"to access a computer with authorization and to use such access to obtain or alter information in the computer that the accesser is not entitled so to obtain or alter.\" Specifically, the Court examined whether this provision applies only to obtaining information from areas of a computer (e.g., files, folders, or databases) to which the user's authorization does not extend (a \"gates-up-or-down\" inquiry), or also to misusing otherwise authorized access for an improper purpose in violation of employer policy.\n\n### 3. Conclusion/Holding\nThe Court reversed the Eleventh Circuit in a 6-3 decision (opinion by Justice Barrett, joined by Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh; dissent by Justice Thomas, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito) and remanded. Van Buren did not violate the CFAA because he accessed the database with authorization using valid credentials and was entitled to obtain license-plate information from it, notwithstanding his improper purpose. The Court held that \"exceeds authorized access\" under \u00a71030(e)(6) covers only those who obtain information from particular off-limits areas of an authorized computer, not those who misuse access to otherwise available information.\n\n**Reasoning**: (1) Text: The parties agreed Van Buren accessed a protected computer with authorization and obtained information; the dispute turned on \"not entitled so to obtain.\" \"So\" is a term of reference to the prior manner stated\u2014obtaining information via an authorized computer\u2014meaning entitlement is assessed based on access rights to the information's location, not purpose (citing Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1246 (5th ed. 1979)). The Government's broader reading of \"so\" (any circumstance-based limits) lacks textual support and renders \"so\" a hook for external restrictions. \"So\" is not superfluous, as it clarifies digital access entitlement and forecloses non-computer defenses. The dissent's focus on \"entitled\" as circumstance-dependent ignores its modification by \"so to obtain.\" Ordinary meaning of \"exceeds authorized access\" yields to the statutory definition, consistent with \"access\" as entry in computing contexts. (2) Structure: \u00a71030(a)(2) distinguishes \"without authorization\" (outside hackers) from \"exceeds authorized access\" (inside hackers entering restricted areas within authorized systems), both via gates-up-or-down inquiries; the Government's purpose-based reading creates inconsistency. Civil remedies under \u00a71030(g) focus on technological \"damage\" or \"loss\" (\u00a7\u00a71030(e)(8), (11)), fitting hacking harms, not misuse of accessible data. (3) Precedent and history: Musacchio v. United States, 577 U.S. 237 (2016), did not resolve the issue (dicta only); Congress's 1986 removal of the 1984 Act's explicit \"purpose\" language (\u00a71030(a)(2), 98 Stat. 2191) cuts against purpose-based liability. (4) Implications: The Government's view would criminalize commonplace activity (e.g., personal emails on work computers, terms-of-service violations) and inject arbitrariness based on policy phrasing. The ruling sets precedent narrowing CFAA liability to unauthorized entry or off-limits areas, not improper use.\n\n## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:\n   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?\n   - **Severity Assessment**:\n     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**\n     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**\n     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**\n\n2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:\n   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**\n   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**\n\n3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:\n   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**\n   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**\n\n## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):\nScore based on the *worst* error found.
