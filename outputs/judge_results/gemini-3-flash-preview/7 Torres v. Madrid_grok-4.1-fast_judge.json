Your job is to find ANY and ALL errors in AI-generated Supreme Court case summaries.\n\nCompare the GENERATED SUMMARY against the REFERENCE SUMMARY (ground truth).\n\n## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):\nFacts of the case\n\nIn 2014, Roxanne Torres was involved in an incident with police officers in which she was operating a vehicle under the influence of methamphetamine and in the process of trying to get away, endangered the two officers pursuing her. In the process, one of the officers shot and injured her. Torres pleaded no contest to three crimes: (1) aggravated fleeing from a law enforcement officer, (2) assault on a police officer, and (3) unlawfully taking a motor vehicle.\n\nIn October 2016, she filed a civil-rights complaint in federal court against the two officers, alleging claims including excessive force and conspiracy to engage in excessive force. Construing Torres's complaint as asserting the excessive-force claims under the Fourth Amendment, the court concluded that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity. In the court's view, the officers had not seized Torres at the time of the shooting, and without a seizure, there could be no Fourth Amendment violation. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed.\n\nQuestion\nMust physical force used to detain a suspect be successful to constitute a \"seizure\" under the Fourth Amendment?\n\nConclusion\nThe application of physical force to the body of a person with intent to restrain is a seizure, even if the force does not succeed in subduing the person. Chief Justice John Roberts authored the majority opinion.\n\nUnder the Court's precedents, common law arrests are considered seizures under the Fourth Amendment, and the application of force to the body of a person with intent to restrain constitutes an arrest even if the arrestee escapes. The use of a device, here, a gun, to effect the arrest, makes no difference in the outcome; it is still a seizure. There is no reason to draw an \"artificial line\" between grasping an arrestee with a hand and using some other means of applying physical force to effect an arrest. The key consideration is whether the conduct objectively manifests the intent to restrain; subjective perceptions are irrelevant. Additionally, the requirement of intent to restrain lasts only as long as the application of force. In this case, the officers' conduct clearly manifested intent to restrain Torres and was thus a seizure under the Fourth Amendment.\n\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch authored a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito joined, arguing that \"neither the Constitution nor common sense\" support the majority's definition of a seizure.\n\n\n## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):\n### 1. Facts of the Case\nPetitioner Roxanne Torres sued respondents Janice Madrid and Richard Williamson, officers with the New Mexico State Police, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983, alleging that they used excessive force, constituting an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment. On July 15, 2014, the officers arrived at an Albuquerque apartment complex to execute an arrest warrant for a woman accused of white-collar crimes and suspected of involvement in drug trafficking, murder, and other violent crimes. The officers observed Torres, who was experiencing methamphetamine withdrawal, standing near a Toyota FJ Cruiser. As the officers approached, Torres entered the driver's seat. Believing the officers\u2014who wore tactical vests marked with police identification but whom she perceived only as armed carjackers\u2014posed a threat, Torres accelerated to escape. Neither officer stood in the vehicle's path, but both fired their service pistols 13 times, striking Torres twice in the back and temporarily paralyzing her left arm. Steering with her right arm, Torres exited the complex, drove a short distance, stopped in a parking lot, asked a bystander to report an attempted carjacking, stole a nearby idling Kia Soul, and drove 75 miles to a hospital in Grants, New Mexico. She was airlifted to a hospital in Albuquerque, where police arrested her the next day. Torres pleaded no contest to aggravated fleeing from a law enforcement officer, assault on a peace officer, and unlawfully taking a motor vehicle. The District Court granted summary judgment to the officers. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed, holding that \"a suspect\u2019s continued flight after being shot by police negates a Fourth Amendment excessive-force claim,\" relying on its precedent that \"no seizure can occur unless there is physical touch or a show of authority,\" and that \"such physical touch (or force) must terminate the suspect\u2019s movement\" or give rise to physical control (Brooks v. Gaenzle, 614 F.3d 1213, 1223 (CA10 2010); Torres v. Madrid, 769 Fed. Appx. 654, 657 (CA10 2019)). The Supreme Court granted certiorari (589 U.S. ___ (2019)).\n\n### 2. Legal Question(s)\nThe Court addressed whether the application of physical force to the body of a person with intent to restrain constitutes a Fourth Amendment seizure even if the person does not submit and is not subdued, specifically whether an officer seizes a person by shooting her if she temporarily eludes capture after the shooting. The Court examined the meaning of \"seizure\" under the Fourth Amendment by reference to the common law of arrest, distinguishing seizures effected by physical force from those by show of authority, and rejected an alternative test of intentional acquisition of physical control.\n\n### 3. Conclusion/Holding\nThe Court held that the application of physical force to the body of a person with intent to restrain is a Fourth Amendment seizure even if the person does not submit and is not subdued (Pp. 3\u201318). Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court, joined by Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan, and Kavanaugh. The Court reasoned that its precedents interpret \"seizure\" by consulting the common law of arrest, the \"quintessential\" seizure of the person (Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 585; California v. Hodari D., 499 U.S. 621, 624 (1991)). At common law, the application of physical force with intent to restrain constituted an arrest\u2014even if the person did not yield\u2014based on the \"slightest touching\" as constructive detention (e.g., Genner v. Sparks, 6 Mod. 173, 87 Eng. Rep. 928 (QB 1704); 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 288 (1768); cases like Anonymus, 1 Vent. 306, 86 Eng. Rep. 197 (KB 1677); Nicholl v. Darley, 2 Y. & J. 399, 400, 148 Eng. Rep. 974 (Exch. 1828)). This rule applied equally to criminal and civil arrests and extended to force from a distance, such as a bullet, as the Fourth Amendment focuses on individual privacy and security, not the form of intrusion (Camara v. Municipal Court of City and County of San Francisco, 387 U.S. 523, 528 (1967)). A seizure requires force applied with objective intent to restrain, not by accident or other purpose (County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 844 (1998); Michigan v. Chesternut, 486 U.S. 567, 574 (1988)), independent of officer or suspect subjective motivations or perceptions. A seizure by force lasts only as long as the force is applied, absent submission (Hodari D., 499 U.S., at 625). The Court rejected the officers' proposed uniform test of \"intentional acquisition of physical control\" (Brower v. County of Inyo, 489 U.S. 593, 596 (1989)), as it lacks historical or precedential support, conflates seizures by force (requiring mere-touch rule) with those by control or show of authority (requiring submission or termination of movement), and creates line-drawing uncertainties avoided by the common law rule. Applying the rule, the officers seized Torres for the instant the bullets struck her, manifesting objective intent to restrain her movement. The Court did not address the reasonableness of the seizure, damages, or qualified immunity. The judgment of the Tenth Circuit (769 Fed. Appx. 654) was vacated and remanded. Justice Gorsuch filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Thomas and Alito. Justice Barrett took no part.\n\n## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:\n   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?\n   - **Severity Assessment**:\n     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**\n     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**\n     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**\n\n2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:\n   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**\n   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**\n\n3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:\n   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**\n   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**\n\n## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):\nScore based on the *worst* error found.
