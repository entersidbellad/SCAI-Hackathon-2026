Your job is to find ANY and ALL errors in AI-generated Supreme Court case summaries.\n\nCompare the GENERATED SUMMARY against the REFERENCE SUMMARY (ground truth).\n\n## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):\nFacts of the case\n\nIn NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma, 468 U.S. 85 (1984), the Supreme Court struck down the NCAA's television plan as violating antitrust law, but in so doing it held that the rules regarding eligibility standards for college athletes are subject to a different and less stringent analysis than other types of antitrust cases. Because of this lower standard, the NCAA has long argued that antitrust law permits them to restrict athlete compensation to promote competitive equity and to distinguish college athletics from professional sports.\n\nSeveral Division 1 football and basketball players filed a lawsuit against the NCAA, arguing that its restrictions on \"non-cash education-related benefits,\" violated antitrust law under the Sherman Act. The district court found for the athletes, holding that the NCAA must allow for certain types of academic benefits, such as \"computers, science equipment, musical instruments and other tangible items not included in the cost of attendance calculation but nonetheless related to the pursuit of academic studies.\" However, the district court held that the NCAA may still limit cash or cash-equivalent awards for academic purposes. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, recognizing the NCAA's interest in \"preserving amateurism,\" but concluding nevertheless that its practices violated antitrust law.\n\nQuestion\nDoes the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)'s prohibition on compensation for college athletes violate federal antitrust law?\n\nConclusion\nThe NCAA's rules restricting certain education-related benefits for student-athletes violate federal antitrust laws. Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Neil Gorsuch upheld the trial court's ruling. The Court affirmed that the traditional \"rule of reason\" standard was appropriate in this case and rejected the NCAA's call for a more deferential standard. Because the student-athletes who brought the lawsuit did not appeal the Ninth Circuit's ruling upholding the NCAA's rules \"untethered to education,\" the Court did not pass judgment on that aspect of the case.\n\nIn affirming the Ninth Circuit's ruling, the Court clarified that a prior statement made in the 1984 case NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma noting that the NCAA's role in maintaining the \"revered tradition of amateurism\" was \"entirely consistent with the goals of the Sherman Act\" was not a shield against all challenges to compensation restrictions, as such rules were not even at issue in that case. Instead, there was nothing so unique about the NCAA or amateur sports to alter the traditional method of analysis applied to claims of antitrust violations.\n\nIn a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted that while other rules limiting student-athlete compensation unrelated to academics remain in place because they were not properly before the Court, this decision makes clear that the same traditional \"rule of reason\" analysis would apply. He concluded, \"there are serious questions whether the NCAA's remaining compensation rules can pass muster under ordinary rule of reason scrutiny.\"\n\n\n## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):\n### 1. Facts of the Case\nCurrent and former student-athletes in men\u2019s Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) football and men\u2019s and women\u2019s Division I basketball, including named plaintiff Shawne Alston, filed a class-action antitrust lawsuit against the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and 11 Division I conferences (collectively, the NCAA), consolidated with American Athletic Conference et al. v. Alston et al., Nos. 20-512 and 20-520. The plaintiffs challenged the NCAA\u2019s rules limiting compensation and benefits for student-athletes as violations of \u00a71 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a71. Key undisputed facts included: the NCAA and its members agreed to compensation limits; the NCAA enforced these limits on member schools; and the limits affected interstate commerce and depressed student-athlete compensation below competitive market levels. After years of pretrial proceedings and a 10-day bench trial in In re National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Athletic Grant-in-Aid Cap Antitrust Litig., 375 F. Supp. 3d 1058 (ND Cal. 2019), the district court upheld NCAA rules limiting undergraduate athletic scholarships and compensation unrelated to education but enjoined rules capping education-related benefits, such as graduate or vocational school scholarships, academic tutoring payments, and post-eligibility internships. The injunction took effect in August 2020, applied only to NCAA and multi-conference agreements (leaving individual conferences free to impose restrictions), and allowed the NCAA to define education-related benefits and regulate their provision. Both sides appealed. The Ninth Circuit affirmed in full, holding the district court \u201cstruck the right balance,\u201d 958 F. 3d 1239, 1263 (2020). The NCAA petitioned for certiorari, seeking reversal of the injunction; the student-athletes did not challenge the upheld rules. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the enjoined restrictions on the premise of the NCAA\u2019s monopsony power in the market for student-athlete labor in Division I basketball and FBS football.\n\n### 2. Legal Question(s)\nThe Court addressed whether the NCAA\u2019s restrictions on student-athlete compensation\u2014specifically, the subset limiting education-related benefits\u2014are subject to ordinary rule of reason analysis under the Sherman Act or entitled to more deferential review (e.g., quick-look or abbreviated scrutiny) as a joint venture preserving amateurism; whether National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla., 468 U. S. 85 (1984), approved the NCAA\u2019s compensation limits; whether the NCAA merits a Sherman Act exemption as a noncommercial entity advancing undergraduate education; and whether the district court\u2019s application of the rule of reason\u2014requiring proof of anticompetitive effects, procompetitive justifications, and substantially less restrictive alternatives\u2014and its injunction were lawful, including claims of imposing a least-restrictive-means test, redefining amateurism, and micromanaging the NCAA.\n\n### 3. Conclusion/Holding\nThe Court unanimously affirmed the Ninth Circuit, holding the district court\u2019s injunction consistent with established antitrust principles. Justice Gorsuch delivered the opinion. The NCAA\u2019s compensation restrictions are subject to ordinary rule of reason analysis\u2014a fact-specific assessment of market power and actual effects on competition\u2014rather than quick-look approval, as the NCAA exercises monopsony power in the labor market for Division I basketball and FBS football student-athletes, suppressing wages and labor quantity below competitive levels. Board of Regents did not analyze or approve compensation limits (focusing instead on television restraints) and its comments on amateurism were non-binding dicta in a changed market. The NCAA receives no antitrust exemption for pursuing noncommercial educational objectives, as the Sherman Act applies regardless and exemptions are for Congress. The district court correctly applied the rule of reason: plaintiffs proved substantial anticompetitive effects (undisputed); the NCAA\u2019s procompetitive justification (preserving consumer demand for amateur college sports distinct from professional sports) succeeded only for non-education-related limits; and plaintiffs showed substantially less restrictive alternatives for education-related benefits, which \u201cemphasize that the recipients are students\u201d without blurring the college-professional distinction or impairing demand. The injunction was narrowly tailored, preserving NCAA leeway to define and regulate education-related benefits, cap academic awards (not below athletic awards of $5,980 annually), police unrelated compensation, and allowing conferences stricter rules; it avoids least-restrictive-means scrutiny or micromanagement. Precedent: NCAA compensation rules receive no special deference and must withstand rule of reason scrutiny; courts must avoid rote frameworks but assess restraints\u2019 effects, justifications, and alternatives cautiously, mindful of judicial limits in dynamic markets. Justice Kavanaugh concurred, noting the decision requires ordinary rule of reason scrutiny for remaining NCAA compensation rules and questioning their procompetitive justification.\n\n## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:\n   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?\n   - **Severity Assessment**:\n     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**\n     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**\n     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**\n\n2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:\n   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**\n   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**\n\n3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:\n   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**\n   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**\n\n## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):\nScore based on the *worst* error found.
