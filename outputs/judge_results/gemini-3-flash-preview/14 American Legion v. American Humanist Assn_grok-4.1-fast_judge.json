Your job is to find ANY and ALL errors in AI-generated Supreme Court case summaries.\n\nCompare the GENERATED SUMMARY against the REFERENCE SUMMARY (ground truth).\n\n## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):\nFacts of the case\n\nIn Bladensburg, Maryland, as part of a memorial park honoring veterans is a 40-foot tall cross, which is the subject of this litigation. Construction on the cross began in 1918, and it was widely described using Christian terms and celebrated in Christian services. In 1961, Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission acquired the cross and the land, as well as the responsibility to maintain, repair, and otherwise care for the cross. The Commission has spent approximately $117,000 to maintain and repair the cross, and in 2008, it set aside an additional $100,000 for renovations.\n\nSeveral non-Christian residents of Prince George's County, Maryland, expressed offense at the cross, which allegedly amounts to governmental affiliation with Christianity. American Humanist Association is a nonprofit organization advocating for separation of church and state. Together, AHA and the individual residents sued the Commission under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that the Commission's display and maintenance of the cross violates the Establishment Clause. Applying the test established in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971), the district court found that the Commission did not violate the Establishment Clause because (1) the cross has a secular purpose, (2) it neither advances nor inhibits religion, and (3) it does not have a primary effect of endorsing religion. The Fourth Circuit reversed and remanded.\n\nQuestion\n1. Is the display and maintenance of the cross unconstitutional?\n2. Under what test should the constitutionality of a passive display incorporating religious symbolism be assessed?\n3. Does the expenditure of funds to maintain the cross amount to the government's excessive entanglement with religion?\n\nConclusion\nThe Bladensburg Cross does not violate the Establishment Clause.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito authored the opinion of the Court, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Stephen Breyer and Brett Kavanaugh. Justice Elena Kagan joined the majority opinion in part.\n\nThe Court explained that although the cross originated as a Christian symbol, it has also taken on a secular meaning. In particular, the cross became a symbol of World War I as evidenced by its use in the present controversy. The Lemon test, which the Court first articulated in 1971 as a way to discern Establishment Clause violations, does not serve its intended purpose, particularly as applied to religious symbols or monuments. Thus, when the question arises whether to keep a religious monument in place (as opposed to a question whether to put up a new one), there should be a presumption that the monument is constitutional.\n\nApplying this presumption rather than the Lemon test, the Court found the Bladensburg Cross does not violate the Establishment Clause because it has historical importance beyond its admittedly Christian symbolism.\n\nJustice Breyer joined Justice Alito's opinion in full but wrote a separate concurrence joined by Justice Kagan to highlight his belief that there is no single test for Establishment Clause violations. Rather, a court asked to resolve such questions must consider \"the basic purposes that the Religion Clauses were meant to serve: assuring religious liberty and tolerance for all, avoiding religiously based social conflict, and maintaining that separation of church and state that allows each to flourish in its separate sphere.\"\n\nJustice Kavanaugh also joined Justice Alito's opinion in full and also wrote his own concurring opinion. He even more harshly criticized the Lemon test, arguing that \"the Court's decisions over the span of several decades demonstrate that the Lemon test is not good law and does not apply to Establishment Clause cases in any of\" five categories, which he enumerated.\n\nJustice Kagan joined most of Justice Alito's opinion but wrote a separate concurrence to note that, although \"rigid application of the Lemon test does not solve every Establishment Clause problem,\" courts should still focus on the purpose and effect of government action in deciding whether it violates the Constitution.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate opinion concurring in the judgment, but based on entirely different reasoning. Justice Thomas does not believe the Establishment Clause applies to state and local governments, and even if it did, it applies only to prevent coercive action by the government. Justice Thomas would overrule the Lemon test in all contexts.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch wrote a separate opinion concurring in the judgment, in which Justice Thomas joined. Justice Gorsuch would dismiss the lawsuit for lack of standing, arguing that simply being offended by the cross's presence is insufficient to meet the injury requirement of Article III standing.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Sonia Sotomayor joined. Justice Ginsburg argued that the cross \"is the foremost symbol of the Christian faith,\" and using it as a war memorial doesn't change that. Maryland's decision to maintain that Christian symbol on public land \"elevates Christianity over other faiths, and religion over nonreligion.\" Justice Ginsburg additionally pointed out that an appropriate remedy for an Establishment Clause violation is not necessarily to destroy the memorial, as the majority suggests, but to transfer title to the land on which it sits to a private entity\u2014in fact, a private entity owned the land when the cross was first erected.\n\n\n## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):\n### 1. Facts of the Case\nIn 1918, residents of Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, formed a committee to erect a memorial honoring the county\u2019s soldiers who died in World War I. The committee selected a plain Latin cross as the design, a symbol associated with the war due to images of white crosses marking soldiers\u2019 graves overseas. Funded by private donations, the 32-foot-tall concrete Latin cross was completed in 1925 by the local American Legion post after the committee exhausted funds. The cross sits on a pedestal displaying the American Legion emblem, the words \u201cValor,\u201d \u201cEndurance,\u201d \u201cCourage,\u201d and \u201cDevotion,\u201d and a bronze plaque listing the names of 49 county soldiers who died in the war, along with dates of U.S. involvement and a quote from President Woodrow Wilson. The dedication ceremony included an invocation by a Catholic priest and a benediction by a Baptist pastor. The cross has since been the site of patriotic events on Veterans Day, Memorial Day, and Independence Day, and is now in Veterans Memorial Park amid monuments to veterans of other wars. As the surrounding area developed into a busy intersection, the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (Commission) acquired the cross and surrounding land in 1961 to preserve the monument and address traffic safety, reserving the American Legion\u2019s right to use the site for ceremonies. The Commission has since spent public funds, including approximately $117,000 over five decades and a budgeted $100,000 in 2008, to maintain it.\n\nIn 2014, the American Humanist Association (AHA) and three individuals filed suit against the Commission in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, alleging that the cross\u2019s presence on public land and the Commission\u2019s maintenance violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The American Legion intervened as a defendant. The District Court granted summary judgment for the Commission and American Legion, finding the cross satisfied the Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971), test and Justice Breyer\u2019s analysis in Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U.S. 677 (2005). The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed, 874 F. 3d 195 (2017), holding the cross failed Lemon\u2019s \u201ceffects\u201d prong as a reasonable observer would perceive endorsement of Christianity and created excessive entanglement. The Fourth Circuit denied rehearing en banc. The American Legion and Commission petitioned for certiorari, which the Supreme Court granted and consolidated, 586 U.S. ___ (2018).\n\n### 2. Legal Question(s)\nDoes the government\u2019s ownership and maintenance of the Bladensburg Cross\u2014a 32-foot-tall Latin cross on public land commemorating World War I soldiers\u2014violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment?\n\n### 3. Conclusion/Holding\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Fourth Circuit\u2019s judgment and remanded in a judgment announced by Justice Alito, with Parts I, II-B, II-C, III, and IV of his opinion joined by Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Breyer, Justice Kagan, and Justice Kavanaugh, and Parts II-A and II-D joined by Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Breyer, and Justice Kavanaugh (effectively 5-4 on key parts). The Court held the Bladensburg Cross does not violate the Establishment Clause.\n\nJustice Alito\u2019s plurality opinion concluded that longstanding religious monuments, symbols, and practices warrant a strong presumption of constitutionality due to four considerations distinguishing them from new ones: (1) difficulty ascertaining original purposes due to age (citing Salazar v. Buono, 559 U.S. 700 (2010)); (2) multiplication and evolution of purposes over time, potentially obscuring religious origins in favor of historical or cultural significance (citing Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U.S. 677; McCreary County v. American Civil Liberties Union of Ky., 545 U.S. 844 (2005); Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U.S. 460 (2009)); (3) transformation of meaning through familiarity (e.g., city names like Bethlehem, Pennsylvania; Arizona\u2019s motto \u201cDitat Deus\u201d; Maryland\u2019s flag); and (4) non-neutral appearance of removal, evoking hostility to religion. Applied here, the cross\u2019s association with World War I\u2014via grave markers, Distinguished Service Cross (1918), Navy Cross (1919), and poetry like John McCrae\u2019s \u201cIn Flanders Fields\u201d\u2014gave it secular meaning as a symbol of sacrifice, reinforced by its age (94 years), integration into the community amid other veterans\u2019 memorials, lack of discriminatory intent (names of Black and White soldiers included; Jewish veteran involved; ecumenical dedication amid 1920s Klan activity), and role commemorating specific deaths akin to faith symbols in other memorials (e.g., Martin Luther King, Jr. memorials; Holocaust memorials with Stars of David). Parts II-A and II-D critiqued Lemon v. Kurtzman\u2019s purpose/effects/entanglement test as unworkable and abandoned in cases like Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills Sch. Dist., 509 U.S. 1 (1993); Town of Greece v. Galloway, 572 U.S. 565 (2014); instead favoring a history-and-tradition approach exemplified by Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.S. 783 (1983) (legislative prayer).\n\nJustice Breyer concurred (joined by Justice Kagan), agreeing no single formula resolves Establishment Clause cases and upholding based on context: cross\u2019s WWI association, secular motives, lack of exclusion, placement among secular memorials, 94-year history without controversy. Justice Kavanaugh concurred, applying history-and-tradition test, rejecting Lemon across categories, and outlining principles (non-coercive, rooted in history/tradition, equal treatment, or accommodations). Justice Thomas concurred in the judgment, arguing the Clause is not incorporated against states (citing Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1 (1947)); no coercion (historical establishments involved orthodoxy/financial penalties); religious displays need not be nonsectarian (citing Town of Greece); and overruling Lemon entirely. Justice Gorsuch concurred in the judgment (joined by Justice Thomas), urging dismissal for lack of standing as \u201coffended observer\u201d theory lacks basis (citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555 (1992); Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, 454 U.S. 464 (1982)); tied to Lemon, now shelved.\n\nJustices Ginsburg (joined by Justice Sotomayor) dissented, arguing the cross endorses Christianity (citing County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U.S. 573 (1989)), unmitigated by context, history, or war memorial purpose.\n\nThe decision sets precedent favoring history, tradition, and context over Lemon for longstanding religious monuments/symbols/practices, presuming their constitutionality absent coercion or discrimination, while preserving case-by-case analysis.\n\n## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:\n   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?\n   - **Severity Assessment**:\n     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**\n     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**\n     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**\n\n2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:\n   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**\n   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**\n\n3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:\n   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**\n   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**\n\n## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):\nScore based on the *worst* error found.
