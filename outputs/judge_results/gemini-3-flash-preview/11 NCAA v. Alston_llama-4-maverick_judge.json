Your job is to find ANY and ALL errors in AI-generated Supreme Court case summaries.\n\nCompare the GENERATED SUMMARY against the REFERENCE SUMMARY (ground truth).\n\n## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):\nFacts of the case\n\nIn NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma, 468 U.S. 85 (1984), the Supreme Court struck down the NCAA's television plan as violating antitrust law, but in so doing it held that the rules regarding eligibility standards for college athletes are subject to a different and less stringent analysis than other types of antitrust cases. Because of this lower standard, the NCAA has long argued that antitrust law permits them to restrict athlete compensation to promote competitive equity and to distinguish college athletics from professional sports.\n\nSeveral Division 1 football and basketball players filed a lawsuit against the NCAA, arguing that its restrictions on \"non-cash education-related benefits,\" violated antitrust law under the Sherman Act. The district court found for the athletes, holding that the NCAA must allow for certain types of academic benefits, such as \"computers, science equipment, musical instruments and other tangible items not included in the cost of attendance calculation but nonetheless related to the pursuit of academic studies.\" However, the district court held that the NCAA may still limit cash or cash-equivalent awards for academic purposes. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, recognizing the NCAA's interest in \"preserving amateurism,\" but concluding nevertheless that its practices violated antitrust law.\n\nQuestion\nDoes the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)'s prohibition on compensation for college athletes violate federal antitrust law?\n\nConclusion\nThe NCAA's rules restricting certain education-related benefits for student-athletes violate federal antitrust laws. Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Neil Gorsuch upheld the trial court's ruling. The Court affirmed that the traditional \"rule of reason\" standard was appropriate in this case and rejected the NCAA's call for a more deferential standard. Because the student-athletes who brought the lawsuit did not appeal the Ninth Circuit's ruling upholding the NCAA's rules \"untethered to education,\" the Court did not pass judgment on that aspect of the case.\n\nIn affirming the Ninth Circuit's ruling, the Court clarified that a prior statement made in the 1984 case NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma noting that the NCAA's role in maintaining the \"revered tradition of amateurism\" was \"entirely consistent with the goals of the Sherman Act\" was not a shield against all challenges to compensation restrictions, as such rules were not even at issue in that case. Instead, there was nothing so unique about the NCAA or amateur sports to alter the traditional method of analysis applied to claims of antitrust violations.\n\nIn a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted that while other rules limiting student-athlete compensation unrelated to academics remain in place because they were not properly before the Court, this decision makes clear that the same traditional \"rule of reason\" analysis would apply. He concluded, \"there are serious questions whether the NCAA's remaining compensation rules can pass muster under ordinary rule of reason scrutiny.\"\n\n\n## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):\n### Summary of NCAA v. Alston\n\n#### 1. Facts of the Case\nThe National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and its member institutions have rules limiting the compensation that student-athletes can receive. Current and former student-athletes brought an antitrust lawsuit challenging these restrictions under \u00a71 of the Sherman Act. The district court, after a bench trial, found that the NCAA enjoys monopsony power in the market for student-athletes' labor and that its compensation limits produce significant anticompetitive effects. The court enjoined certain NCAA rules limiting education-related benefits but upheld rules limiting undergraduate athletic scholarships and other compensation related to athletic performance. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, and the NCAA appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\n#### 2. Legal Question(s)\nThe Supreme Court addressed whether the NCAA's compensation restrictions should be subjected to antitrust scrutiny under the \"rule of reason\" analysis and whether the district court's injunction was consistent with established antitrust principles.\n\n#### 3. Conclusion/Holding\nThe Supreme Court held that the district court's injunction is consistent with established antitrust principles. The Court applied the rule of reason analysis, which requires a fact-specific assessment of market power and market structure to assess the challenged restraint's actual effect on competition. The NCAA's compensation restrictions were found to have significant anticompetitive effects, and the district court properly considered the NCAA's procompetitive justifications and the availability of substantially less restrictive alternatives. The Court affirmed the Ninth Circuit's decision, upholding the district court's injunction against the NCAA's rules limiting education-related benefits. The Court's ruling establishes that the NCAA's remaining compensation rules will be subject to ordinary rule of reason scrutiny under the antitrust laws going forward.\n\n## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:\n   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?\n   - **Severity Assessment**:\n     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**\n     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**\n     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**\n\n2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:\n   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**\n   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**\n\n3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:\n   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**\n   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**\n\n## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):\nScore based on the *worst* error found.
