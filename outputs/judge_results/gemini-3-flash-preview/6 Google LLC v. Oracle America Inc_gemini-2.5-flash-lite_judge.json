Your job is to find ANY and ALL errors in AI-generated Supreme Court case summaries.\n\nCompare the GENERATED SUMMARY against the REFERENCE SUMMARY (ground truth).\n\n## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):\nFacts of the case\n\nWhen Google implemented its Android Operating System (Android OS), it wrote its own programming language based on Java, which is owned by Oracle. To facilitate developers writing their own programs for Android OS, Google's version used the same names, organization, and functionality as Java's Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).\n\nOracle sued Google for copyright infringement, but the federal district judge held that APIs are not subject to copyright because permitting a private entity to own the copyright to a programming language would stifle innovation and collaboration, contrary to the goals of copyright. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the lower court, finding that the Java APIs are copyrightable but leaving open the possibility of a fair use defense. The U.S. Supreme Court denied Google's petition for certiorari.\n\nUpon remand to the district court, a jury found that Google's use of the Java API was fair use. Oracle appealed, and the Federal Circuit again reversed the lower court. The Federal Circuit held that Google's use was not fair as a matter of law.\n\nQuestion\n1. Does copyright protection extend to a software interface? \n2. If so, does the petitioner's use of a software interface in the context of creating a new computer program constitute fair use?\n\nConclusion\nAssuming a software interface may be subject to copyright protection, Google's limited copying of the Java SE Application Programming Interface constituted a fair use of that material under copyright law. Justice Stephen Breyer authored the 6-2 majority opinion.\n\nCopyright law aims to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by simultaneously granting creators exclusive copyrights and limiting the scope of such rights through the fair use doctrine. To decide no more than necessary to resolve the case, the Court assumed that software code is subject to copyright protection.\n\nCourts consider four statutory factors in evaluating whether a secondary use is fair. First, Google's use of the Java APIs is transformative. Google copied only what was necessary to allow programmers to work in a different computing environment but with a familiar programming language. Second, the copied lines are \"inherently bound together with uncopyrightable ideas,\" suggesting that the application of fair use to this context is unlikely to undermine the general copyright protection that Congress provided for computer programs. Third, Google copied only .4% of the entire API, weighing in favor of fair use. Finally, the record shows that Google's new smartphone platform is not a market substitute for Java SE. Because all four factors support a finding of fair use, Google's limited copying constituted fair use.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas authored a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Samuel Alito joined, arguing that the Court should have addressed the question whether Oracle's code is copyrightable. Justice Thomas would have concluded that it is, and then he would have found that Google's use of that copyrighted code was not fair. By copying Oracle's code, Google \"erased 97.5% of the value of Oracle's partnership with Amazon, made tens of billions of dollars, and established its position as the owner of the largest mobile operating system in the world.\"\n\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.\n\n\n## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):\nHere is a summary of the Supreme Court's opinion in *Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc.*:\n\n### 1. Facts of the Case\n\nOracle America, Inc. (Oracle) owned the copyright to Java SE, a computer platform utilizing the Java programming language. In 2005, Google acquired Android and sought to develop a new software platform for mobile devices. To facilitate adoption by the millions of programmers familiar with Java, Google copied approximately 11,500 lines of code from Java SE's Application Programming Interface (API). These copied lines were part of the \"declaring code\" within the API, which allows programmers to call prewritten computing tasks.\n\nThis case has a lengthy history through the lower courts. Initially, the courts considered whether the copied lines were copyrightable and, if so, whether Google's use constituted \"fair use.\" The Federal Circuit held that the copied lines were copyrightable. Subsequently, a jury found that Google's use was a fair use. However, the Federal Circuit reversed this finding, ruling as a matter of law that Google's copying was not fair use. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the Federal Circuit's determinations on both copyrightability and fair use.\n\n### 2. Legal Question(s)\n\nThe Supreme Court addressed two primary legal questions:\n1.  Is the declaring code within the Java SE API copyrightable?\n2.  If the declaring code is copyrightable, did Google's copying of this code constitute a \"fair use\" under the Copyright Act, thereby excusing it from liability for copyright infringement?\n\nThe Court explicitly stated that to resolve the case, it would *assume* for argument's sake that the copied lines were copyrightable and focus its analysis on the fair use question.\n\n### 3. Conclusion/Holding\n\nThe Supreme Court held that Google's copying of the Java SE API, specifically the declaring code, was a fair use as a matter of law. The Court reversed the judgment of the Federal Circuit.\n\nThe Court's reasoning centered on an analysis of the four statutory fair use factors:\n\n*   **Nature of the Copyrighted Work:** The Court found this factor weighed in favor of fair use. It noted that the declaring code, as part of a user interface, is \"inextricably bound\" with uncopyrightable ideas (task organization) and new creative expression (Google's implementing code). The value of this code also derives significantly from the investment of programmers who learn it, rather than solely from the copyright holder's creativity. This nature, the Court reasoned, places it further from the \"core of copyright\" than many other computer programs.\n*   **Purpose and Character of the Use:** The Court determined that Google's use was \"transformative.\" Google copied only what was necessary to allow programmers familiar with Java to work in the new Android smartphone environment without having to learn an entirely new system. This facilitated the creation of a new platform (Android) for a different computing environment, which the Court viewed as consistent with copyright's constitutional objective to promote progress.\n*   **Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used:** While Google copied a significant amount of declaring code (11,500 lines), the Court considered this in relation to the entire API (2.86 million lines), finding the copied portion to be a small percentage. More importantly, the Court reasoned that the copying was \"tethered to a valid, and transformative, purpose.\" Google copied the declaring code not for its inherent creativity but because it was necessary to unlock programmers' existing skills for the new platform.\n*   **Effect of the Use Upon the Potential Market:** The Court found this factor also weighed in favor of fair use. The evidence suggested that Google's Android platform was not a market substitute for Java SE. Furthermore, the Court noted that Sun (Oracle's predecessor) had business challenges in the mobile market and that the reimplementation of its API might even benefit the broader Java ecosystem by expanding the network of Java-trained programmers. The Court also expressed concern that enforcing copyright on such interfaces could harm public creativity by creating a \"lock\" on future innovation.\n\nThe Court concluded that, when applied to the functional nature of computer programs and the specific context of reimplementing a user interface to enable programmers to use their existing skills in a new and transformative program, Google's copying constituted fair use. The Court emphasized that its decision did not alter existing fair use precedent but rather applied those principles to the unique circumstances of computer software.\n\n## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:\n   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?\n   - **Severity Assessment**:\n     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**\n     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**\n     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**\n\n2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:\n   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**\n   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**\n\n3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:\n   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**\n   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**\n\n## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):\nScore based on the *worst* error found.
