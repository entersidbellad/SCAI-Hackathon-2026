  "_prompt_used": "You are a highly critical, pedantic legal scholar auditor. Your job is to find ANY and ALL errors in AI-generated Supreme Court case summaries.\n\nCompare the GENERATED SUMMARY against the REFERENCE SUMMARY (ground truth).\n\n## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):\nFacts of the case\nCitizens United sought an injunction against the Federal Election Commission in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to prevent the application of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) to its film Hillary: The Movie. The Movie expressed opinions about whether Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton would make a good president.\n\nIn an attempt to regulate \"big money\" campaign contributions, the BCRA applies a variety of restrictions to \"electioneering communications.\" Section 203 of the BCRA prevents corporations or labor unions from funding such communication from their general treasuries. Sections 201 and 311 require the disclosure of donors to such communication and a disclaimer when the communication is not authorized by the candidate it intends to support.\n\nCitizens United argued that: 1) Section 203 violates the First Amendment on its face and when applied to The Movie and its related advertisements, and that 2) Sections 201 and 203 are also unconstitutional as applied to the circumstances.\n\nThe United States District Court denied the injunction. Section 203 on its face was not unconstitutional because the Supreme Court in McConnell v. FEC had already reached that determination. The District Court also held that The Movie was the functional equivalent of express advocacy, as it attempted to inform voters that Senator Clinton was unfit for office, and thus Section 203 was not unconstitutionally applied. Lastly, it held that Sections 201 and 203 were not unconstitutional as applied to the The Movie or its advertisements. The court reasoned that the McConnell decision recognized that disclosure of donors \"might be unconstitutional if it imposed an unconstitutional burden on the freedom to associate in support of a particular cause,\" but those circumstances did not exist in Citizen United's claim.\n\nQuestion\n1) Did the Supreme Court's decision in McConnell resolve all constitutional as-applied challenges to the BCRA when it upheld the disclosure requirements of the statute as constitutional?\n\n2) Do the BCRA's disclosure requirements impose an unconstitutional burden when applied to electioneering requirements because they are protected \"political speech\" and not subject to regulation as \"campaign speech\"?\n\n3) If a communication lacks a clear plea to vote for or against a particular candidate, is it subject to regulation under the BCRA?\n\n4) Should a feature length documentary about a candidate for political office be treated like the advertisements at issue in McConnell and therefore be subject to regulation under the BCRA?\n\nConclusion\nNo. No. Yes. Yes. The Supreme Court overruled Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce and portions of McConnell v. FEC. (In the prior cases, the Court had held that political speech may be banned based on the speaker's corporate identity.) By a 5-to-4 vote along ideological lines, the majority held that under the First Amendment corporate funding of independent political broadcasts in candidate elections cannot be limited. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the majority joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justices Antonin G. Scalia, Samuel A. Alito, and Clarence Thomas. Justice John Paul Stevens dissented, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, and Sonia Sotomayor. The majority maintained that political speech is indispensable to a democracy, which is no less true because the speech comes from a corporation. The majority also held that the BCRA's disclosure requirements as applied to The Movie were constitutional, reasoning that disclosure is justified by a \"governmental interest\" in providing the \"electorate with information\" about election-related spending resources. The Court also upheld the disclosure requirements for political advertising sponsors and it upheld the ban on direct contributions to candidates from corporations and unions.\n\nIn a separate concurring opinion, Chief Justice Roberts, joined by Justice Alito, emphasized the care with which the Court handles constitutional issues and its attempts to avoid constitutional issues when at all possible. Here, the Court had no narrower grounds upon which to rule, except to handle the First Amendment issues embodied within the case. Justice Scalia also wrote a separate concurring opinion, joined by Justices Alito and Thomas in part, criticizing Justice Stevens' understanding of the Framer's view towards corporations. Justice Stevens argued that corporations are not members of society and that there are compelling governmental interests to curb corporations' ability to spend money during local and national elections.\n\n## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):\n### 1. Facts of the Case\nCitizens United, a nonprofit corporation with an annual budget of about $12 million funded mostly by individual donations and a small portion from for-profit corporations, produced a 90-minute documentary film entitled *Hillary: The Movie* (referred to as *Hillary*), which was critical of then-Senator Hillary Clinton, a candidate for her party's 2008 presidential nomination. Citizens United sought to make *Hillary* available on cable television through video-on-demand within 30 days of primary elections and produced television ads (two 10-second and one 30-second) to promote it on broadcast and cable television. Anticipating civil and criminal penalties under 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441b (as amended by \u00a7 203 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA)), which prohibits corporations and unions from using general treasury funds for \"electioneering communications\" or speech expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate, Citizens United filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. It argued that \u00a7 441b was unconstitutional as applied to *Hillary* and the ads, and that BCRA \u00a7\u00a7 201 and 311 (disclosure and disclaimer requirements) were unconstitutional as applied to *Hillary* and the ads. A three-judge district court denied Citizens United's motion for a preliminary injunction, 530 F. Supp. 2d 274 (D.D.C. 2008) (*per curiam*), and granted summary judgment to the Federal Election Commission (FEC), App. 261a\u2013262a. Citizens United appealed directly to the Supreme Court under BCRA \u00a7 403(a).\n\n### 2. Legal Question(s)\nThe Court addressed: (1) whether 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441b (as amended by BCRA \u00a7 203) is facially valid under the First Amendment or unconstitutional as applied to *Hillary* and the ads promoting it, including whether the Court should overrule *Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce*, 494 U.S. 652 (1990) (upholding restrictions on corporate independent expenditures based on corporate identity), and the part of *McConnell v. Federal Election Comm'n*, 540 U.S. 93, 203\u2013209 (2003), upholding BCRA \u00a7 203's extension of \u00a7 441b; (2) whether narrower grounds resolved the case without overruling *Austin*, such as whether *Hillary* qualifies as an \"electioneering communication\" under \u00a7 441b(b)(2) and 11 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.29, whether \u00a7 441b applies under *Federal Election Comm'n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.*, 551 U.S. 449 (2007) (*WRTL*), whether video-on-demand poses less risk of distortion than television ads, or whether a nonprofit corporate exception applies; and (3) whether BCRA \u00a7\u00a7 201 and 311 (disclosure and disclaimer requirements) are constitutional as applied to *Hillary* and the ads.\n\n### 3. Conclusion/Holding\nThe Court (in a 5-4 opinion by Justice Kennedy, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Scalia and Alito; Justice Thomas joined all but Part IV) held that \u00a7 441b's prohibitions on corporate and union independent expenditures for electioneering communications or express advocacy are facially invalid under the First Amendment and overruled *Austin* and the relevant part of *McConnell* upholding BCRA \u00a7 203. Political speech is central to the First Amendment and subject to strict scrutiny, requiring the Government to prove a restriction furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored; no such interest justifies suppressing corporate political speech based on speaker identity. The Court rejected narrower grounds as unsustainable and found resolving the case without facial review would chill speech due to \u00a7 441b's complexity and the need for prior FEC permission. *Austin*'s \"antidistortion\" rationale (preventing distorting effects of corporate wealth) was rejected as inconsistent with First Amendment protections for corporate speech (*e.g.*, *First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti*, 435 U.S. 765 (1978); *Buckley v. Valeo*, 424 U.S. 1 (1976) (*per curiam*)); independent expenditures do not corrupt or appear to corrupt (*Buckley*, 424 U.S. at 47); shareholder protection and foreign influence interests were under- and overinclusive; *stare decisis* factors (antiquity, reliance, workability) favored overruling *Austin*. PACs do not alleviate \u00a7 441b's burdens. The Court upheld BCRA \u00a7\u00a7 201 and 311 as applied to the ads and *Hillary* under exacting scrutiny, as they impose no ceiling on speech and advance a sufficiently important informational interest without evidence of threats or harassment to Citizens United's donors (*Buckley*, 424 U.S. at 66, 76; *McConnell*, 540 U.S. at 196). Judgment reversed in part, affirmed in part, and remanded. Precedent: Corporations and unions may make unlimited independent expenditures from general treasury funds; overrules *Austin* and *McConnell* on corporate/union independent expenditures; upholds disclosure/disclaimer requirements.\n\n## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:\n   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?\n   - **Severity Assessment**:\n     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**\n     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**\n     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**\n\n2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:\n   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**\n   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**\n\n3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:\n   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**\n   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**\n\n## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):\nScore based on the *worst* error found.
