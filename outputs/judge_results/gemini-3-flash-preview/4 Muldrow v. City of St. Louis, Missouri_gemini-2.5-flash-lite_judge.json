Your job is to find ANY and ALL errors in AI-generated Supreme Court case summaries.\n\nCompare the GENERATED SUMMARY against the REFERENCE SUMMARY (ground truth).\n\n## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):\nFacts of the case\nSergeant Muldrow, initially assigned to the Intelligence Division where she worked on various high-profile cases and was deputized by the FBI, was transferred to the Fifth District by Interim Police Commissioner Lawrence O'Toole's appointee, Captain Deeba. This change led to a different work schedule, responsibilities, and loss of special FBI-related privileges including a potential $17,500 in annual overtime pay. After her transfer, Sergeant Muldrow was asked to return FBI-issued equipment, which she did, and her Task Force Officer status was revoked. She filed a discrimination charge with the Missouri Commission on Human Rights against the City of St. Louis and Captain Deeba, later filing an action in Missouri state court alleging Title VII violations.\n\nThe case was removed to federal court, where the district court granted summary judgment against her Title VII claims and dismissed her state law claims. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed, holding that the employment decisions she alleged did not constitute \u201cadverse employment action\u201d and thus did not establish a prima facie case of gender discrimination under Title VII, nor were they \u201cmaterially adverse action\u201d as required for a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII.\n\nQuestion\nDoes Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibit discrimination in transfer decisions absent a separate court determination that the transfer decision caused a signification disadvantage?\n\nConclusion\nAn employee challenging a job transfer under Title VII must show that the transfer brought about some harm with respect to an identifiable term or condition of employment, but that harm need not be significant. Although the judgment vacating and remanding the case was unanimous, Justice Elena Kagan authored the majority opinion of the Court, which was joined by five other Justices.\n\nNothing in Title VII\u2019s text requires a transferred employee to show that the harm they suffered was \u201csignificant.\u201d Rather, as long as the transfer left the employee worse off in some way with respect to their employment terms or conditions, and was made because of a protected characteristic like sex or race, it violates Title VII\u2019s prohibition on discrimination. There is no basis for reading a heightened \u201csignificant harm\u201d standard into the statute. Title VII targets employment practices that treat a person worse because of a protected trait, without distinguishing between significant and less significant harms. While concerns about frivolous lawsuits are valid, courts have other ways to dismiss meritless claims without imposing an extra-textual \"significant harm\" requirement.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas authored an opinion concurring in the judgment suggesting that the majority misinterpreted the opinion by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, below. Justice Thomas argued that the appeals court\u2019s language requiring \u201ca tangible change in working conditions that produces a material employment disadvantage\u201d is not a heightened-harm requirement.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito authored an opinion concurring in the judgment criticizing the majority for failing to clarify the degree of harm required under Title VII, arguing that there is \u201clittle if any substantive difference between the terminology the Court approves and the terminology it doesn\u2019t like.\u201d\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh authored an opinion concurring in the judgment, arguing that while he agrees with the majority in rejecting the \u201csignificant employment disadvantage\u201d requirement, he disagrees with its new standard requiring \u201csome harm.\u201d Justice Kavanaugh provided an example of a situation that clearly violates Title VII but may not satisfy the majority\u2019s \u201csome harm\u201d requirement: \u201cWe are transferring you to the Cincinnati office because you are black. But your compensation will not change.\u201d Any transfer on a discriminatory basis\u2014no matter how quantifiable the harm\u2014should be a violation of Title VII.\n\n## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):\nHere is a summary of the Supreme Court's opinion in *Muldrow v. City of St. Louis, Missouri, et al.*:\n\n### 1. Facts of the Case\n\nSergeant Jatonya Clayborn Muldrow worked as a plainclothes officer in the St. Louis Police Department's Intelligence Division from 2008 to 2017. In 2017, the new commander of the Intelligence Division requested Muldrow's transfer so he could replace her with a male officer. Despite Muldrow's objections, the Department approved the transfer, reassigning her to a uniformed position elsewhere. While her rank and pay remained the same, her responsibilities, perks, and schedule changed significantly. She no longer worked with high-ranking officials on departmental priorities but instead supervised neighborhood patrol officers. She also lost access to an unmarked take-home vehicle and had a less regular schedule that included weekend shifts.\n\nMuldrow filed a lawsuit against the City of St. Louis under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, alleging that the transfer constituted sex discrimination with respect to the terms or conditions of her employment. The District Court granted summary judgment to the City, and the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. The Eighth Circuit held that Muldrow had to demonstrate a \"materially significant disadvantage\" resulting from the transfer, which she failed to do, as her title, salary, and benefits did not decrease, and the changes in her working conditions were considered minor. Muldrow petitioned the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to address a split among the Circuit Courts regarding the required level of harm for a Title VII transfer claim.\n\n### 2. Legal Question(s)\n\nThe primary legal question before the Supreme Court was:\n\n*   Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, must an employee challenging a job transfer based on sex discrimination demonstrate that the transfer caused a \"significant\" or \"materially adverse\" disadvantage, or is a lesser showing of harm sufficient?\n\n### 3. Conclusion/Holding\n\nThe Supreme Court held that an employee challenging a job transfer under Title VII must show that the transfer brought about some harm with respect to an identifiable term or condition of employment, but that harm **need not be significant**.\n\nThe Court reasoned that Title VII, 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1), prohibits employers from discriminating against any individual \"with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s . . . sex.\" The Court clarified that \"discriminate against\" means to \"treat worse\" and that this treatment must be \"with respect to\" the \"terms [or] conditions\" of employment. While this requires showing a \"disadvantageous\" change, the statutory text does not impose a heightened threshold of \"significance\" or \"materiality.\" The Court rejected the City's arguments based on statutory text (ejusdem generis), precedent (distinguishing *Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White*, 548 U. S. 53, which applied a \"materially adverse\" standard to the anti-retaliation provision), and policy concerns about increased litigation.\n\nThe Court vacated the Eighth Circuit's judgment, finding that it applied the wrong standard by requiring Muldrow to show a \"significant\" disadvantage. The Court stated that Muldrow need only show some injury respecting her employment terms or conditions, and her allegations, if properly preserved and supported, met this less stringent test. The Court remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with its opinion, allowing the lower courts to address issues of forfeiture and proof under the correct Title VII standard.\n\n## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:\n   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?\n   - **Severity Assessment**:\n     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**\n     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**\n     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**\n\n2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:\n   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**\n   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**\n\n3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:\n   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**\n   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**\n\n## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):\nScore based on the *worst* error found.
