  "_prompt_used": "You are a highly critical, pedantic legal scholar auditor. Your job is to find ANY and ALL errors in AI-generated Supreme Court case summaries.\n\nCompare the GENERATED SUMMARY against the REFERENCE SUMMARY (ground truth).\n\n## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):\nFacts of the case\n\nPetitioners Kendra Espinoza and others are low-income mothers who applied for scholarships to keep their children enrolled in Stillwater Christian School, in Kalispell, Montana. The Montana legislature enacted a tax-credit scholarship program in 2015 to provide a modest tax credit to individuals and businesses who donate to private, nonprofit scholarship organizations. Shortly after the program was enacted, the Montana Department of Revenue promulgated an administrative rule (\"Rule 1\") prohibiting scholarship recipients from using their scholarships at religious schools, citing a provision of the state constitution that prohibits \"direct or indirect\" public funding of religiously affiliated educational programs.\n\nEspinoza and the other mothers filed a lawsuit in state court challenging Rule 1. The court determined that the scholarship program was constitutional without Rule 1 and granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the Department of Revenue argued that the program is unconstitutional without Rule 1. The Montana Supreme Court agreed with the Department and reversed the lower court.\n\nQuestion\nDoes a state law that allows for funding for education generally while prohibiting funding for religious schools violate the Religion Clauses or the Equal Protection Clause of the federal Constitution?\n\nConclusion\nThe application of the Montana Constitution's \"no-aid\" provision to a state program providing tuition assistance to parents who send their children to private schools discriminated against religious schools and the families whose children attend or hope to attend them in violation of the Free Exercise Clause. Chief Justice John Roberts authored the opinion on behalf of the 5-4 majority.\n\nThe Court first noted that the Free Exercise Clause \"protects religious observers against unequal treatment\" and against \"laws that impose special disabilities on the basis of religious status.\" In this case, Montana's no-aid provision excluded religious schools from public benefits solely because of religious status. As such, the law must be subject to strict scrutiny review; that is, the government must show that its action advances \"'interests of the highest order\" and that the action is \"narrowly tailored in pursuit of those interests.\" Montana's interest in this case\u2014which the Court described as creating greater separation of church and state than the federal Constitution requires\u2014does not satisfy strict scrutiny given its infringement of free exercise. Because the Free Exercise Clause barred the application of Montana's no-aid provision, the Montana Supreme Court lacked the authority to invalidate the program on the basis of that provision.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas authored a concurring opinion in which Justice Neil Gorsuch joined, opining that the Court's interpretation of the Establishment Clause (not at issue in this case) hampers free exercise rights.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito and Justice Gorsuch each filed their own separate concurrences. Justice Alito argued that original motivation should have no bearing on the present constitutionality of a provision of law, yet even without that consideration, the majority reached the correct conclusion in this case. Justice Gorsuch argued that the Court's characterization of the Montana Constitution as discriminating based on \"religious status\" and not \"religious use,\" is dubious at best.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Elena Kagan joined, arguing that the Montana Supreme Court's decision does not place a burden on petitioners' religious exercise and thus does not violate the Free Exercise Clause. The Court's precedents establish that neutral government action is not unconstitutional solely because it fails to benefit religious exercise.\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Elena Kagan joined in part.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor filed a separate dissenting opinion, arguing that the Court in this case resolved a constitutional question not presented, thereby violating \"Article III principles older than the Religion Clause\" itself.\n\n\n## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):\n### 1. Facts of the Case\nPetitioners Kendra Espinoza and two other mothers sued the Montana Department of Revenue in Montana state court after being blocked by Department \"Rule 1\" (Mont. Admin. Rule \u00a742.4.802(1)(a) (2015)) from using scholarships from the Big Sky Scholarship organization for their children's tuition at Stillwater Christian School, a private Christian school meeting statutory criteria for qualified education providers under Mont. Code Ann. \u00a715\u201330\u20133102(7). The scholarship program, enacted by the Montana Legislature in 2015 (2015 Mont. Laws p. 2168; Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a715\u201330\u20133101 et seq.), provided tax credits of up to $150 to donors supporting organizations awarding scholarships for private school tuition, with $3 million allotted annually and automatic 10% increases if exhausted, set to expire in 2023. Big Sky Scholarships, the sole participating organization, focused on families facing financial hardship or with children with disabilities, awarding scholarships of $500 each (44 in 2017, 54 in 2018). The program was to be administered consistent with Montana Constitution Art. X, \u00a76(1), barring aid to schools \"controlled in whole or in part by any church, sect, or denomination.\" Rule 1 excluded religious schools to comply with this no-aid provision, despite objections from the Montana Attorney General. The trial court enjoined Rule 1, finding it unauthorized as the no-aid provision bars only appropriations, not tax credits. The Montana Supreme Court reversed (393 Mont. 446, 435 P.3d 603 (2018)), holding the unmodified program violated the no-aid provision by subsidizing tuition at religiously affiliated schools and lacked mechanisms to prevent aid to religious schools, invalidating the entire program. The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari (588 U.S. ___ (2019)).\n\n### 2. Legal Question(s)\nWhether the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment (applicable to the States via the Fourteenth Amendment) barred the Montana Supreme Court's application of Montana Constitution Art. X, \u00a76(1) to invalidate a tax-credit scholarship program that would otherwise permit religious schools to receive indirect aid through parental choice, thereby excluding religious schools and families solely on the basis of the schools' religious status.\n\n### 3. Conclusion/Holding\nThe Court reversed the Montana Supreme Court (5-4, opinion by Chief Justice Roberts, joined by Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh, JJ.; concurrences by Thomas (joined by Gorsuch, J.), Alito, J., and Gorsuch, J.; dissents by Ginsburg (joined by Kagan, J.), Breyer (joined by Kagan, J. as to Part I), and Sotomayor, JJ.) and remanded. The application of Montana's no-aid provision violated the Free Exercise Clause by disqualifying otherwise eligible religious schools from public benefits solely because of their religious status, imposing a penalty on free exercise that triggers strict scrutiny (Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer, 582 U.S. ___ (2017)). The provision expressly bars aid to schools \"controlled in whole or in part by any church, sect, or denomination\" (Mont. Const., Art. X, \u00a76(1)), discriminating based on status rather than religious use of funds. Distinguished Locke v. Davey, 540 U.S. 712 (2004), where denial targeted an \"essentially religious endeavor\" (devotional theology degrees) supported by a \"historic and substantial\" tradition against funding clergy; no comparable tradition bars aid to religious schools, and early governments often supported them. Rejected flexible case-by-case analysis as inconsistent with Trinity Lutheran. Montana's interests\u2014greater church-state separation, promoting religious freedom, or protecting public education\u2014failed strict scrutiny (Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 546 (1993)), as they were not compelling and the provision was underinclusive (barring only religious private schools). The Montana Supreme Court erred by applying the no-aid provision despite the Free Exercise violation; under the Supremacy Clause (Art. VI, cl. 2), it had no basis to invalidate the program and was obligated to disregard the provision (Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 178 (1803)). Precedent: A State deciding to subsidize private education cannot disqualify religious schools solely because of their religious character; such status-based discrimination triggers strict scrutiny under the Free Exercise Clause.\n\n## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:\n   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?\n   - **Severity Assessment**:\n     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**\n     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**\n     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**\n\n2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:\n   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**\n   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**\n\n3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:\n   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**\n   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**\n\n## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):\nScore based on the *worst* error found.
