## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
{ground_truth}

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
{llm_summary}

## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:

1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:
   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?
   - **Severity Assessment**:
     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**
     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**
     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**

2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:
   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**
   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**

3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:
   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**
   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**

## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):
Score based on the *worst* error found. Do not sum penalties below 1.

- **5 (Perfect)**: Flawless. No hallucinations, covers holding, reasoning, concurrences, and dissents.
- **4 (Minor Flaw)**: Generally accurate but missed a **Concurrence** OR has a **Trivial** factual error (e.g., typos, minor date slip).
- **3 (Major Flaw)**: Missed the **Dissent** OR has a **Substantial** hallucination (clearly wrong but doesn't change outcome).
- **2 (Critical Failure)**: Missed the **Main Holding** OR has a **Critical** hallucination (reversed law/facts).
- **1 (Catastrophic)**: Completely wrong case, incoherent, or dangerously misleading.

## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:

1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:
   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?
   - **Severity Assessment**:
     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**
     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**
     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**

2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:
   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**
   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**

3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:
   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**
   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**

## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):
Score based on the *worst* error found. Do not sum penalties below 1.

- **5 (Perfect)**: Flawless. No hallucinations, covers holding, reasoning, concurrences, and dissents.
- **4 (Minor Flaw)**: Generally accurate but missed a **Concurrence** OR has a **Trivial** factual error (e.g., typos, minor date slip).
- **3 (Major Flaw)**: Missed the **Dissent** OR has a **Substantial** hallucination (clearly wrong but doesn't change outcome).
- **2 (Critical Failure)**: Missed the **Main Holding** OR has a **Critical** hallucination (reversed law/facts).

## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:

1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:
   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?
   - **Severity Assessment**:
     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**
     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**
     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**

2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:
   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**
   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**

3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:
   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**
   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**

## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):

## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:

1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:
   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?
   - **Severity Assessment**:
     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**
     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**
     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**

2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:
   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**
   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**

3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:
   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**
   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**

## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):
Score based on the *worst* error found. Do not sum penalties below 1.

- **5 (Perfect)**: Flawless. No hallucinations, covers holding, reasoning, concurrences, and dissents.
- **4 (Minor Flaw)**: Generally accurate but missed a **Concurrence** OR has a **Trivial** factual error (e.g., typos, minor date slip).
- **3 (Major Flaw)**: Missed the **Dissent** OR has a **Substantial** hallucination (clearly wrong but doesn't change outcome).
- **2 (Critical Failure)**: Missed the **Main Holding** OR has a **Critical** hallucination (reversed law/facts).

2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:
   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**
   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**

3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:
   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**
   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**

## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
{ground_truth}

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
{llm_summary}

## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:

1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:
   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?
   - **Severity Assessment**:
     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**
     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**
     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**

2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:
   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**
   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**

3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:
   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**
   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**

## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):
Score based on the *worst* error found. Do not sum penalties below 1.

- **5 (Perfect)**: Flawless. No hallucinations, covers holding, reasoning, concurrences, and dissents.
- **4 (Minor Flaw)**: Generally accurate but missed a **Concurrence** OR has a **Trivial** factual error (e.g., typos, minor date slip).
- **3 (Major Flaw)**: Missed the **Dissent** OR has a **Substantial** hallucination (clearly wrong but doesn't change outcome).
- **2 (Critical Failure)**: Missed the **Main Holding** OR has a **Critical** hallucination (reversed law/facts).
- **1 (Catastrophic)**: Completely wrong case, incoherent, or dangerously misleading.

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
{ground_truth}

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
{llm_summary}

## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:

1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:
   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?
   - **Severity Assessment**:
     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**
     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**
     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**

2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:
   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**
   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**

3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:
   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**
   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**

## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):
Score based on the *worst* error found. Do not sum penalties below 1.

- **5 (Perfect)**: Flawless. No hallucinations, covers holding, reasoning, concurrences, and dissents.
- **4 (Minor Flaw)**: Generally accurate but missed a **Concurrence** OR has a **Trivial** factual error (e.g., typos, minor date slip).
- **3 (Major Flaw)**: Missed the **Dissent** OR has a **Substantial** hallucination (clearly wrong but doesn't change outcome).
- **2 (Critical Failure)**: Missed the **Main Holding** OR has a **Critical** hallucination (reversed law/facts).
- **1 (Catastrophic)**: Completely wrong case, incoherent, or dangerously misleading.

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
{ground_truth}

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
{llm_summary}

## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:

1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:
   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?
   - **Severity Assessment**:
     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**
     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**
     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**

2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:
   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**
   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**

3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:
   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**
   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**

## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):
Score based on the *worst* error found. Do not sum penalties below 1.

- **5 (Perfect)**: Flawless. No hallucinations, covers holding, reasoning, concurrences, and dissents.
- **4 (Minor Flaw)**: Generally accurate but missed a **Concurrence** OR has a **Trivial** factual error (e.g., typos, minor date slip).
- **3 (Major Flaw)**: Missed the **Dissent** OR has a **Substantial** hallucination (clearly wrong but doesn't change outcome).
- **2 (Critical Failure)**: Missed the **Main Holding** OR has a **Critical** hallucination (reversed law/facts).
- **1 (Catastrophic)**: Completely wrong case, incoherent, or dangerously misleading.

## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:

1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:
   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?
   - **Severity Assessment**:
     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**
     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**
     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**

2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:
   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**
   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**

3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:
   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**
   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**

## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
{ground_truth}

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
{llm_summary}

## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:

1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:
   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?
   - **Severity Assessment**:
     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**
     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**
     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**

2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:
   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**
   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**

3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:
   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**
   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**

## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):
Score based on the *worst* error found. Do not sum penalties below 1.

- **5 (Perfect)**: Flawless. No hallucinations, covers holding, reasoning, concurrences, and dissents.
- **4 (Minor Flaw)**: Generally accurate but missed a **Concurrence** OR has a **Trivial** factual error (e.g., typos, minor date slip).
- **3 (Major Flaw)**: Missed the **Dissent** OR has a **Substantial** hallucination (clearly wrong but doesn't change outcome).
- **2 (Critical Failure)**: Missed the **Main Holding** OR has a **Critical** hallucination (reversed law/facts).
- **1 (Catastrophic)**: Completely wrong case, incoherent, or dangerously misleading.

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
{ground_truth}

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
{llm_summary}

## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:

1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:
   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?
   - **Severity Assessment**:
     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**
     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**
     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**

2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:
   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**
   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**

3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:
   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**
   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**

## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):
Score based on the *worst* error found. Do not sum penalties below 1.

- **5 (Perfect)**: Flawless. No hallucinations, covers holding, reasoning, concurrences, and dissents.
- **4 (Minor Flaw)**: Generally accurate but missed a **Concurrence** OR has a **Trivial** factual error (e.g., typos, minor date slip).
- **3 (Major Flaw)**: Missed the **Dissent** OR has a **Substantial** hallucination (clearly wrong but doesn't change outcome).
- **2 (Critical Failure)**: Missed the **Main Holding** OR has a **Critical** hallucination (reversed law/facts).
- **1 (Catastrophic)**: Completely wrong case, incoherent, or dangerously misleading.

Compare the GENERATED SUMMARY against the REFERENCE SUMMARY (ground truth).

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
{ground_truth}

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
{llm_summary}

## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:

1. **Step 1: Accuracy Check (Hallucinations)**:
   - Does the summary contain facts not in the reference?
   - **Severity Assessment**:
     - *Trivial* (Detailed date wrong, minor phrasing): **Minor Issue (-1)**
     - *Substantial* (Invented detail, wrong party name): **Major Issue (-2)**
     - *Critical* (Changes the legal outcome/holding): **Critical Issue (-3)**

2. **Step 2: Legal Precision Check (Holding/Reasoning)**:
   - Did it miss the main holding? **Critical Issue (-3)**
   - Did it miss a key reasoning step? **Major Issue (-2)**

3. **Step 3: Completeness Check (Opinions)**:
   - Missed the **Dissent**? **Major Omission (-2)**
   - Missed a **Concurrence**? **Minor Omission (-1)**

## SCORING RUBRIC (1-5 Integer Scale):
Score based on the *worst* error found. Do not sum penalties below 1.

- **5 (Perfect)**: Flawless. No hallucinations, covers holding, reasoning, concurrences, and dissents.
- **4 (Minor Flaw)**: Generally accurate but missed a **Concurrence** OR has a **Trivial** factual error (e.g., typos, minor date slip).
- **3 (Major Flaw)**: Missed the **Dissent** OR has a **Substantial** hallucination (clearly wrong but doesn't change outcome).
- **2 (Critical Failure)**: Missed the **Main Holding** OR has a **Critical** hallucination (reversed law/facts).
- **1 (Catastrophic)**: Completely wrong case, incoherent, or dangerously misleading.
