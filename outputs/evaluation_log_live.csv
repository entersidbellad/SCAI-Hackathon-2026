## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
Facts of the case

Employees of the City of Ontario, California police department filed a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim in a California federal district court against the police department, city, chief of police, and an internal affairs officer. They alleged Fourth Amendment violations in relation to the police department's review of text messages made by an employee on a city issued text-message pager. While the city did not have an official text-messaging privacy policy, it did have a general ""Computer Usage, Internet and E-mail Policy."" The policy in part stated that ""[t]he City of Ontario reserves the right to monitor and log all network activity including e-mail and Internet use, with or without notice,"" and that ""[u]sers should have no expectation of privacy or confidentiality when using these resources."" Employees were told verbally that the text-messaging pagers were considered e-mail and subject to the general policy. The district court entered judgment in favor of the defendants.

On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in part. The court held that city employees had a reasonable expectation of privacy for the text messages they sent on their city-issued pagers because there was no text message privacy policy in place. Moreover, the court noted that the police department's review of the text messages was unreasonable because it could have used ""less intrusive methods"" to determine whether employees' had properly used the text messaging service.

Question
1) Does a city employee have a reasonable expectation of privacy in text messages transmitted on his city-issued pager when the police department has no official privacy policy for the pagers?

2) Did the Ninth Circuit contravene Supreme Court precedent by analyzing whether the police department could have used ""less intrusive methods"" of reviewing text messages?

Conclusion
Not answered. Yes. The Supreme Court held that the City of Ontario did not violate its employees' Fourth Amendment rights because the city's search of Mr. Quon's text messages was reasonable. With Justice Anthony M. Kennedy writing for the majority, the Court reasoned that even assuming that Mr. Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his text messages, the city's search of them was reasonable because it was motivated by a legitimate work-related purpose and was not excessive in scope. In reaching its conclusion, the Court rejected the Ninth Circuit's ""least intrusive"" means approach to the issue.

Justice John Paul Stevens concurred. He observed that the majority had not settled on one of the three approaches enunciated in O'Connor v. Ortega for determining the parameters of a ""reasonable expectation of privacy."" He reasoned that under any of the three approaches, Mr. Quon's expectations were not violated. Justice Antonin Scalia concurred in part and concurred in the judgment. He disagreed that the Court tacitly reaffirmed the O'Connor framework for determining whether the Fourth Amendment applies to public employees, arguing that it was ""standardless"" and ""unsupported.""

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
Here is a summary of the Supreme Court's opinion in *City of Ontario, California, et al. v. Quon et al.*:

### 1. Facts of the Case

The City of Ontario, California, issued alphanumeric pagers to officers in its Police Department (OPD), including Sergeant Jeff Quon, to facilitate communication for emergency situations. The pagers had a contractual character limit with the service provider, Arch Wireless, and exceeding this limit incurred additional fees. When Quon and other officers repeatedly exceeded their limits, OPD Chief Lloyd Scharf initiated an audit of their text messages to determine if the character limit was too low, necessitating payment for work-related messages, or if the overages were due to personal use.

Arch Wireless provided transcripts of Quon's and another officer's text messages from August and September 2002. The review revealed that many of Quon's messages were not work-related and some were sexually explicit. This led to an internal affairs investigation. Sergeant Patrick McMahon, handling the investigation, redacted messages sent while Quon was off duty. The remaining on-duty messages indicated that a significant majority were not related to police business. Quon was subsequently disciplined for violating OPD rules.

Quon and other respondents, who had exchanged text messages with Quon during the audited period, filed a lawsuit. They alleged that the City, OPD, and Chief Scharf violated their Fourth Amendment rights and the Stored Communications Act (SCA) by obtaining and reviewing the pager transcripts. They also alleged that Arch Wireless violated the SCA by providing the transcripts. The District Court initially denied summary judgment on the Fourth Amendment claims, finding Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy, but ultimately granted summary judgment to the petitioners after a jury determined Chief Scharf's audit had a legitimate work-related purpose. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, finding the search unreasonable in scope despite its legitimate purpose, and also ruled that Arch Wireless violated the SCA.

### 2. Legal Question(s)

The primary legal question before the Supreme Court was whether the warrantless search and review of text messages sent and received on a government-issued pager by an employee constituted an unreasonable search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Specifically, the Court considered:
* Whether an employee has a reasonable expectation of privacy in text messages sent on a government-issued pager.
* If an employee does have such an expectation, under what standard should the reasonableness of a government employer's search of those messages be judged.
* Whether the specific search conducted in this case met that standard of reasonableness.

The Court also addressed, but did not definitively resolve, the Stored Communications Act claim against Arch Wireless, as the petition for certiorari on that issue was denied.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding

The Supreme Court held that the search of Jeff Quon's text messages was reasonable and, therefore, the petitioners did not violate respondents' Fourth Amendment rights. The Ninth Circuit's conclusion to the contrary was reversed.

The Court's reasoning focused on the reasonableness of the search under the circumstances, applying the framework established in *O'Connor v. Ortega*, 480 U. S. 709 (1987). Even assuming, *arguendo*, that Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his text messages and that the review constituted a Fourth Amendment search, the Court found the search to be reasonable.

The Court determined the search was justified at its inception because Chief Scharf had a legitimate work-related purpose: to determine the efficacy of the character limits on the City's contract with Arch Wireless. The search was also deemed reasonably related to this objective, as reviewing the transcripts was an efficient way to ascertain whether overages were due to work-related or personal use, and the City had an interest in managing these costs. Furthermore, the search was not excessively intrusive. Although Quon had exceeded his limits multiple times, the City requested transcripts for only two months to gather a sufficient sample, and messages sent while off duty were redacted. The Court also noted that Quon, as a law enforcement officer, should have anticipated that his on-duty communications might be subject to scrutiny.

The Court rejected the Ninth Circuit's ""least intrusive means"" approach, stating that the Fourth Amendment does not require the least intrusive search practicable. The Court also found that the search's reasonableness was not undermined by the possibility that Arch Wireless may have violated the Stored Communications Act.

Finally, the Court addressed the claims of the other respondents who had exchanged messages with Quon. It noted that their argument was contingent on the search being unreasonable as to Quon. Since the Court found the search reasonable as to Quon, these other respondents could not prevail based on their stated legal position.

The precedent set is that a government employer's search of an employee's work-issued communication device, conducted for a legitimate work-related purpose and not excessively intrusive in scope, can be considered reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, even if the employee has some expectation of privacy. The Court emphasized caution in defining broad privacy expectations for employees using employer-provided technology due to the rapid evolution of communication technologies and workplace norms.

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
### 1. Facts of the Case
The City of Ontario, California (City), Ontario Police Department (OPD), and OPD Chief Lloyd Scharf (petitioners) issued alphanumeric pagers capable of sending and receiving text messages to OPD SWAT team members, including respondent Jeff Quon, a police sergeant, in October 2001. The City's contract with Arch Wireless Operating Company limited each pager to 25,000 characters per month, with overages incurring additional fees. The City's Computer Usage, Internet and E-Mail Policy, acknowledged by Quon in March 2000, stated that users had no expectation of privacy in City computer resources, and OPD informed employees, including at an April 18, 2002, meeting attended by Quon and in a Chief Scharf memorandum dated April 29, 2002, that pager text messages were treated as e-mails subject to auditing. Quon exceeded his character limit multiple times starting in the first or second billing cycle, reimbursing the City each time after Lieutenant Steven Duke suggested this alternative to auditing. In August and September 2002, Quon and another officer again exceeded limits. In October 2002, Chief Scharf, tired of collecting overage fees, directed Duke to obtain transcripts from Arch Wireless to determine if the character limit was too low (requiring officers to pay for work-related messages) or if overages were personal. Arch Wireless provided transcripts after verifying the City as subscriber. Review by Duke, Scharf, and Quon's supervisor revealed many non-work-related and sexually explicit messages from Quon. Scharf referred the matter to OPD internal affairs; Sergeant Patrick McMahon redacted off-duty messages using Quon's work schedule and found that of 456 work-hour messages in August 2002, no more than 57 were work-related, leading to Quon's discipline for violating OPD rules.

Respondents Jeff Quon, Jerilyn Quon (his then-separated wife), April Florio (OPD employee romantically involved with Jeff Quon), and Steve Trujillo (OPD SWAT member), each of whom exchanged texts with Jeff Quon in August and September 2002, sued petitioners, Arch Wireless, and another individual under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (Fourth Amendment), 18 U.S.C. § 2701 et seq. (Stored Communications Act, SCA), and California law, alleging violations by obtaining and reviewing Jeff Quon's transcripts. The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California denied respondents summary judgment on Fourth Amendment claims, found via jury that Scharf's purpose was legitimate (efficacy of limits, not time-wasting), and granted petitioners summary judgment, citing O’Connor v. Ortega, 480 U.S. 709 (1987). The Ninth Circuit reversed in part, Quon v. Arch Wireless Operating Co., 529 F. 3d 892 (2008), holding the search unreasonable in scope despite legitimate rationale and that Arch Wireless violated the SCA; rehearing en banc denied, 554 F. 3d 769 (2009). The Supreme Court granted certiorari on petitioners' Fourth Amendment claims, 558 U.S. 1090 (2009), but denied Arch Wireless's petition on the SCA, USA Mobility Wireless, Inc. v. Quon, 558 U.S. 1091 (2009).

### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Court addressed whether petitioners violated respondents' Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures by obtaining and reviewing transcripts of text messages sent and received on Jeff Quon's City-issued pager. The Court examined the analytical framework from O’Connor v. Ortega for government employer searches, including whether Jeff Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his pager messages (considering the Computer Policy, OPD notices, and Duke's statements), whether petitioners' review constituted a Fourth Amendment search, and whether the warrantless search was reasonable under the O’Connor plurality's two-step approach (operational realities of workplace for privacy expectation; then reasonableness under all circumstances for noninvestigatory work-related purposes or work-misconduct investigations) or Justice Scalia's concurrence (government offices generally protected, but searches reasonable/normal in private-employer context do not violate the Fourth Amendment). The Court also considered whether the search's reasonableness turned on Chief Scharf's intent or a ""least intrusive means"" test, and whether it extended unreasonably to messages sent to Jeff Quon by other respondents.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit, 529 F. 3d 892, holding that petitioners did not violate respondents' Fourth Amendment rights because the search of Jeff Quon's pager transcripts was reasonable. Justice Kennedy's opinion (joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Stevens, Thomas, Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito, and Sotomayor; Justice Scalia joined except Part III-A) assumed arguendo that Jeff Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy, that the review was a Fourth Amendment search, and that O’Connor v. Ortega principles apply to employer-provided electronic devices. Under the O’Connor plurality, 480 U.S. at 725-726, the search was justified at inception (jury-found legitimate work-related purpose: determining if 25,000-character limit met City needs and avoided officers paying for work messages or City subsidizing personal use); reasonable in scope (efficient/expedient review of only August-September 2002 transcripts for sample size; off-duty messages redacted by McMahon); and not excessively intrusive (Quon's limited privacy expectation as SWAT officer aware of auditing policy and scrutiny needs; less intrusive than personal email/wiretap). It satisfied Justice Scalia's approach, 480 U.S. at 732, as reasonable/normal in private-employer context. The Ninth Circuit erred by applying a ""least intrusive means"" test, rejected in Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 663 (1995), and cases like Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives’ Assn., 489 U.S. 602 (1989). SCA issues were not before the Court and did not render the search per se unreasonable. Other respondents could not prevail, as they argued the search unreasonable only if unreasonable as to Jeff Quon. Justice Stevens concurred, noting no resolution of O’Connor framework and Quon's limited expectation. Justice Scalia concurred in judgment/part, rejecting O’Connor plurality's ""operational realities"" as standardless and unnecessary here. Precedent: Government employer searches of employee electronic communications are evaluated for reasonableness under O’Connor even assuming privacy expectations; courts should avoid broad rules on evolving technology/workplace norms; no ""least intrusive means"" requirement. Remanded for further proceedings.

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
### Summary of City of Ontario v. Quon

#### 1. Facts of the Case

The City of Ontario, California, issued alphanumeric pagers to its police officers, including Sergeant Jeff Quon, as part of their job. The pagers were subject to a monthly character limit, and the City had a policy stating that employees should have no expectation of privacy when using City computers and other resources. The policy was communicated to employees, including Quon, who signed a statement acknowledging that he understood the policy. When Quon and other officers exceeded their character limits, the Police Department's chief, Lloyd Scharf, ordered an audit of the text messages sent by Quon and another officer in August and September 2002 to determine whether the character limit was sufficient for work-related purposes. The audit revealed that many of Quon's messages were not work-related, and some were sexually explicit. Quon was subsequently disciplined.

#### 2. Legal Question(s)

The case centered on whether the City's audit of Quon's text messages constituted an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment. The specific legal questions addressed by the Court included:

- Whether Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his text messages sent on the City-issued pager.
- Whether the City's search of Quon's text messages was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.

#### 3. Conclusion/Holding

The Supreme Court held that, even assuming Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his text messages, the City's search was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. The Court applied the framework from O'Connor v. Ortega (1987), which provides that a government employer's search of an employee's property is reasonable if it is justified at its inception and reasonably related in scope to the circumstances that justified the search. The Court concluded that the search was justified because it was conducted for a legitimate work-related purpose (to determine whether the character limit was sufficient) and was not excessively intrusive in scope (as it was limited to reviewing transcripts for two months and redacting messages sent while Quon was off-duty). The Court also noted that the search would be considered reasonable and normal in the private-employer context. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.

The Court's decision was based on the assumption that Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy, but it did not definitively resolve the issue. The Court emphasized the need for caution when considering the application of the Fourth Amendment to emerging technologies and workplace norms. The holding established that, under the circumstances, the City's actions did not violate Quon's Fourth Amendment rights, and by extension, did not violate the rights of the other respondents who sent messages to Quon.

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
Facts of the case
After the 2020 census, Alabama created a redistricting plan for its seven seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. One of the districts in the plan is a majority-Black district. Registered voters and several organizations challenged the map, arguing that the state had illegally packed Black voters into a single district while dividing other clusters of Black voters across multiple districts. The challengers alleged that the map effectively minimizes the number of districts in which Black voters can elect their chosen candidates, in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which bans racial discrimination in voting policies.

A three-judge district court agreed with the challengers that the map likely violated Section 2 of the VRA, granting a preliminary injunction that ordered the state to draw a new map. Alabama asked the U.S. Supreme Court to freeze the district court’s injunction, which the Court did by a 5-4 decision pending a merits decision.

Question
Does Alabama’s 2021 redistricting plan for its seven U.S. House seats violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act?

Conclusion
The district court correctly applied binding Supreme Court precedent to conclude that Alabama’s redistricting map likely violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Chief Justice John Roberts authored the majority opinion of the Court.

The Court’s decision in Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30 (1986) sets out a three-part framework for evaluating claims brought under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. First, the plaintiffs must prove that the minority group is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a reasonably configured district (measured by criteria such as contiguity and compactness). Second, the plaintiffs must show that the minority group is politically cohesive. Third, the plaintiffs must show that under the totality of the circumstances, the political process is not “equally open” to minority voters.

The majority applied that three-part framework to the facts in the record and agreed with the district court that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their challenge. The plaintiffs submitted maps demonstrating the traditional districting criteria, and the district court found “no serious dispute” that Black voters are politically cohesive or that the challenged districts’ white majority consistently defeated Black voters’ preferred candidates.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined the majority opinion except for a discussion of the difference between race-consciousness and race-predominance. He concurred separately to emphasize and clarify four additional points.

Justice Clarence Thomas authored a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Neil Gorsuch joined in full, and Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Samuel Alito joined in part. Justice Thomas argued that Section 2 of the VRA does not require Alabama to redraw its congressional districts so that Black voters can control a number of seats proportional to Black voters in its population.

Justice Alito authored a dissenting opinion in which Justice Gorsuch joined arguing that the majority’s understanding of Gingles—specifically its understanding of the phrase “reasonably configured” within the context of the first precondition—is flawed, and that a correct understanding would lead to a different result in this case.

Here is a summary of the Supreme Court's opinion in *Allen v. Milligan*:

## Allen v. Milligan: Summary of Supreme Court Opinion

### 1. Facts of the Case

Following the 2020 decennial census, the State of Alabama redrew its congressional district map, enacting it as House Bill 1 (HB1). A group of Alabama citizens, including Evan Milligan and Marcus Caster, filed lawsuits challenging HB1. They argued that the new map, which continued to produce only one district where Black voters constituted a majority, likely violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) of 1965 and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The plaintiffs contended that Alabama's population growth necessitated the creation of a second majority-Black congressional district, given the state's demographics and history of racial discrimination in voting. A three-judge District Court convened to hear the cases. After an extensive evidentiary hearing, the District Court preliminarily enjoined Alabama from using HB1 in the upcoming congressional elections, finding that the plaintiffs demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of success on their Section 2 claim. The Supreme Court granted review of this decision.

### 2. Legal Question(s)

The primary legal question before the Supreme Court was whether the congressional districting plan adopted by the State of Alabama (HB1) likely violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. §10301. This question involved an examination of how Section 2, as amended in 1982, is applied to redistricting challenges, particularly concerning the *Gingles* framework and the concept of ""reasonably configured"" districts. The Court also considered Alabama's arguments for a ""race-neutral benchmark"" approach and whether Section 2 applies to single-member districts.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding

The Supreme Court affirmed the District Court's determination, holding that the plaintiffs demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of success on their claim that Alabama's redistricting plan (HB1) violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.

The Court's reasoning was as follows:

*   **Application of the *Gingles* Framework:** The Court reiterated that for the past 37 years, it has evaluated Section 2 claims using the three-part framework established in *Thornburg v. Gingles*, 478 U. S. 30 (1986). This framework requires plaintiffs to show: (1) the minority group is large and geographically compact enough to form a majority in a reasonably configured district; (2) the minority group is politically cohesive; and (3) the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to defeat the minority's preferred candidate. If these preconditions are met, the court must then consider the ""totality of circumstances"" to determine if the political processes are equally open to minority voters.
*   **First *Gingles* Precondition:** The Court agreed with the District Court that Black voters in Alabama could constitute a majority in a second, ""reasonably configured"" district. The plaintiffs presented eleven illustrative maps that contained two majority-Black districts while adhering to traditional districting criteria like compactness, contiguity, and respect for political subdivisions. The Court found Alabama's arguments against these maps, such as their alleged failure to preserve the Gulf Coast region as a community of interest, unpersuasive.
*   **Second and Third *Gingles* Preconditions:** The Court affirmed the District Court's finding that there was ""no serious dispute"" that Black voters in Alabama are politically cohesive and that the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to defeat their preferred candidates, citing statistical evidence of racial polarization.
*   **Totality of Circumstances:** The District Court's conclusion that the totality of circumstances demonstrated a Section 2 violation was also affirmed, based on the racial polarization of elections, the lack of Black success in statewide elections, and Alabama's history of racial discrimination.
*   **Rejection of Alabama's ""Race-Neutral Benchmark"" Theory:** The Court rejected Alabama's proposal to use a ""race-neutral benchmark"" derived from computer-generated maps as the primary basis for Section 2 analysis. The Court found this approach inconsistent with its precedent, which focuses on illustrative maps presented by plaintiffs and the totality of circumstances, rather than a statistical average of hypothetical maps. The Court also noted that Alabama's proposed benchmark would require novel and unworkable evidentiary standards.
*   **No Requirement for Proportionality:** The Court clarified that the *Gingles* framework does not mandate racial proportionality in districting, as prohibited by Section 2(b). Instead, it constrains proportionality by requiring adherence to traditional districting principles like compactness and contiguity, as demonstrated in prior cases like *Shaw v. Reno* and *Miller v. Johnson*.
*   **Applicability to Single-Member Districts:** The Court reaffirmed its unanimous precedent that Section 2 and the *Gingles* framework apply to challenges involving single-member districts.
*   **Constitutional Arguments:** The Court rejected Alabama's argument that Section 2 as applied to redistricting is unconstitutional, citing prior decisions that upheld Congress's authority to ban electoral changes discriminatory in effect as a method of promoting the Fifteenth Amendment's purposes.

**Precedent Set:** The decision reaffirms the continued validity and application of the *Gingles* framework for analyzing Section 2 Voting Rights Act claims in redistricting cases. It underscores that while race can be a consideration in districting, it cannot be the predominant factor, and that the VRA prohibits districting plans that dilute minority voting strength, even without proof of discriminatory intent. The Court also reinforced that the analysis requires a holistic review of circumstances, not solely reliance on statistical benchmarks.

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
### 1. Facts of the Case
Alabama's congressional districting map (HB1), enacted in 2021 following the 2020 decennial census showing 5.1% population growth, created seven single-member districts with only one majority-black voting-age population district (District 7), despite black voters comprising approximately 27% of the state's population and 25.9% of its voting-age population. The map largely resembled the prior 2011 map, which traced back to a 1992 map resulting from Wesch v. Hunt, 785 F. Supp. 1491 (SD Ala.), aff'd sub nom. Camp v. Wesch, 504 U.S. 902 (1992), that established Alabama's first majority-black congressional district since 1877.

Three groups of plaintiffs challenged HB1: (1) the Caster plaintiffs, led by Marcus Caster (Caster v. Allen, No. 21–1087), alleging a §2 Voting Rights Act (VRA) violation, 52 U.S.C. §10301; (2) the Milligan plaintiffs, led by Evan Milligan (Milligan v. Merrill, consolidated with Singleton v. Merrill, No. 21–1086), alleging §2 and Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause violations; and (3) the Singleton plaintiffs, led by Bobby Singleton, alleging racial gerrymandering under the Equal Protection Clause. A three-judge District Court (Northern District of Alabama) consolidated Milligan and Singleton for preliminary injunction proceedings and held a hearing with 17 witnesses, over 1,000 pages of briefing, and 350 exhibits. In a 227-page opinion (582 F. Supp. 3d 924 (ND Ala. 2022) (per curiam)), the court found HB1 likely violated §2 under Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30 (1986), and enjoined its use; Judge Manasco issued similar relief in Caster. Alabama appealed to the Supreme Court, which stayed the injunction (595 U.S. ___ (2022)) and noted probable jurisdiction in Milligan while granting certiorari before judgment in Caster from the Eleventh Circuit.

### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Court addressed whether Alabama's HB1 congressional districting map likely violated §2 of the VRA, 52 U.S.C. §10301, which prohibits voting qualifications, prerequisites, standards, practices, or procedures imposed in a manner resulting in denial or abridgment of the right to vote on account of race or color, such that political processes are not equally open to minority voters who have less opportunity than others to participate and elect representatives of their choice. The Court applied the Gingles framework's three preconditions and totality-of-circumstances test: (1) whether black voters were sufficiently large and geographically compact for a majority in a reasonably configured district; (2) political cohesion; and (3) white bloc voting usually defeating black-preferred candidates.

Subsidiary questions included: (a) whether plaintiffs' illustrative maps satisfied the first Gingles precondition as reasonably configured under traditional districting criteria (e.g., compactness, contiguity, equal population, respecting political subdivisions, communities of interest); (b) Alabama's ""race-neutral benchmark"" theory, requiring comparison to race-blind simulated maps rather than plaintiffs' illustrative maps; (c) whether §2 applies to single-member districting challenges; and (d) whether §2, as applied via Gingles to require race-conscious remedies, exceeds Congress's Fifteenth Amendment enforcement authority.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Court affirmed the District Court's determination that plaintiffs demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of success on their §2 claim, holding HB1 violates §2 under Gingles. Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion (joined fully by Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson; Justice Kavanaugh joined except Part III–B–1).

**Reasoning**: The District Court faithfully applied Gingles. Plaintiffs satisfied the first precondition: eleven illustrative maps (e.g., by experts Moon Duchin and Bill Cooper) showed black voters could form a majority in a second reasonably configured district, performing as well as or better than HB1 on compactness, contiguity, equal population, and political subdivisions (e.g., splitting fewer or equal county lines), while respecting communities of interest like the Black Belt; Gulf Coast arguments failed for lack of evidence. Second and third preconditions were undisputed: black voters cohesive (92.3% support for preferred candidates); white bloc voting (15.4% support) defeats them. Totality of circumstances supported violation due to racial polarization, black statewide electoral failure, racial campaign appeals, socioeconomic disparities, and Alabama's history of racial/voting discrimination (e.g., Senate factors from Gingles, 478 U.S. at 36–37).

The Court rejected Alabama's race-neutral benchmark (e.g., Duchin/Imai simulations yielding no two majority-black districts): it revises Gingles, ignores §2 text requiring equal openness (not resemblance to race-blind maps), risks proportionality (expressly disclaimed in §2(b)), imposes novel burdens (e.g., proving deviations ""only"" by race, intent-like standard rejected post-City of Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55 (1980)), and is unworkable given trillions of maps and contestable metrics. Gingles constrains proportionality via traditional criteria (e.g., Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630 (1993); Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900 (1995); Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. 952 (1996)). Illustrative maps need not be race-blind if race does not predominate (Miller, 515 U.S. at 916). §2 applies to single-member districts (e.g., Growe v. Emison, 507 U.S. 25 (1993)); unconstitutional as-applied claim fails (City of Rome v. United States, 446 U.S. 156 (1980)).

**Precedent Set**: Reaffirms Gingles framework (37 years unchanged by Congress) governs §2 claims, including single-member redistricting; plaintiffs' illustrative maps (not race-neutral benchmarks) establish first precondition if reasonably configured without race predominance; totality requires ""intensely local appraisal""; §2 effects test (not intent) applies without proportionality mandate or novel evidentiary burdens. Remand for remedy implied, but injunction affirmed pending further proceedings.

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
Facts of the case
This case was the consolidation of cases arising in Kansas, South Carolina, Virginia, Delaware, and Washington D.C. relating to the segregation of public schools on the basis of race. In each of the cases, African American students had been denied admittance to certain public schools based on laws allowing public education to be segregated by race. They argued that such segregation violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The plaintiffs were denied relief in the lower courts based on Plessy v. Ferguson, which held that racially segregated public facilities were legal so long as the facilities for blacks and whites were equal. (This was known as the “separate but equal” doctrine.) 

Question
Does the segregation of public education based solely on race violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?

Conclusion
Separate but equal educational facilities for racial minorities is inherently unequal, violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Chief Justice Earl Warren delivered the opinion of the unanimous Court. The Supreme Court held that “separate but equal” facilities are inherently unequal and violate the protections of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court reasoned that the segregation of public education based on race instilled a sense of inferiority that had a hugely detrimental effect on the education and personal growth of African American children. Warren based much of his opinion on information from social science studies rather than court precedent. The decision also used language that was relatively accessible to non-lawyers because Warren felt it was necessary for all Americans to understand its logic. 

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
Here is a summary of the Supreme Court opinion in *Brown v. Board of Education*:

**1. Facts of the Case**

This case consolidated four separate lawsuits from Kansas, South Carolina, Virginia, and Delaware. In each instance, minor plaintiffs of the Negro race, through their legal representatives, sought admission to public schools on a nonsegregated basis. They alleged that state laws requiring or permitting racial segregation in public schools denied them the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. In three of the cases (Kansas, South Carolina, and Virginia), three-judge federal district courts denied relief, relying on the ""separate but equal"" doctrine established in *Plessy v. Ferguson*, 163 U. S. 537, even though some found the facilities for Negro children to be inferior and ordered equalization. In the Delaware case, the Delaware Court of Chancery ordered the admission of Negro children to white schools due to the inferiority of the Negro schools, a decision affirmed by the Delaware Supreme Court. The Supreme Court of Delaware, however, indicated that a modification of the decree might be possible after equalization of the Negro and white schools. The cases reached the Supreme Court due to the significant constitutional question presented regarding the legality of state-mandated segregation in public education.

**2. Legal Question(s)**

The central legal question before the Supreme Court was whether segregation of children in public schools solely on the basis of race, even if the physical facilities and other tangible factors are equal, deprives children of the minority group of equal educational opportunities and thus violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court also considered the historical context of the Fourteenth Amendment and its intended application to public education, as well as the continued validity of the ""separate but equal"" doctrine in the context of public schooling.

**3. Conclusion/Holding**

The Supreme Court unanimously held that segregation of children in public schools solely on the basis of race is unconstitutional and violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court reasoned that while the history of the Fourteenth Amendment is inconclusive regarding its specific application to public education, the issue must be decided in light of the present-day importance of public education in American society. The Court found that education is a fundamental right that must be available to all on equal terms. It concluded that segregation, even with equal tangible facilities, generates a feeling of inferiority in minority children, thereby depriving them of equal educational opportunities. The Court explicitly rejected the ""separate but equal"" doctrine as having no place in the field of public education, stating that ""separate educational facilities are inherently unequal."" The Court then restored the cases to the docket for further argument on the specific forms of decrees to be implemented, acknowledging the complexity of desegregating public school systems.

Warren based much of his opinion on information from social science studies rather than court precedent. The decision also used language that was relatively accessible to non-lawyers because Warren felt it was necessary for all Americans to understand its logic. 

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
### 1. Facts of the Case
The consolidated cases—Brown et al. v. Board of Education of Topeka et al. (No. 1, appeal from the United States District Court for the District of Kansas), Briggs et al. v. Elliott et al. (No. 2, appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of South Carolina), Davis et al. v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, Virginia, et al. (No. 4, appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia), and Gebhart et al. v. Belton et al. (No. 10, certiorari to the Supreme Court of Delaware)—involved minor children of the Negro race, through their legal representatives, denied admission to public schools attended by white children under state laws requiring or permitting racial segregation. In the Kansas case, Negro elementary school children in Topeka sought to enjoin a state statute permitting segregation in cities over 15,000 population (Kan. Gen. Stat. § 72-1724 (1949)); the three-judge district court found substantial equality in buildings, transportation, curricula, and teacher qualifications but denied relief (98 F. Supp. 797). In the South Carolina case, Negro elementary and high school children in Clarendon County sought to enjoin state constitutional and statutory segregation requirements (S.C. Const., Art. XI, § 7; S.C. Code § 5377 (1942)); the three-judge district court ordered equalization of facilities but upheld segregation and denied admission to white schools (98 F. Supp. 529, later 103 F. Supp. 920 after remand per 342 U.S. 350). In the Virginia case, Negro high school children in Prince Edward County sought to enjoin similar state provisions (Va. Const., § 140; Va. Code § 22-221 (1950)); the three-judge district court ordered equalization but upheld segregation (103 F. Supp. 337). In the Delaware case, Negro elementary and high school children in New Castle County sought to enjoin state provisions (Del. Const., Art. X, § 2; Del. Rev. Code § 2631 (1935)); the Chancellor and Delaware Supreme Court ordered admission to white schools due to Negro schools' inferiority in teacher training, pupil-teacher ratio, extracurricular activities, physical plant, and transportation (87 A. 2d 862; 91 A. 2d 137). In each case except Delaware, lower federal courts denied relief based on the ""separate but equal"" doctrine from Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537. The cases reached the Supreme Court on direct appeals under 28 U.S.C. § 1253 (Nos. 1, 2, 4) and certiorari (No. 10, 344 U.S. 891), with arguments in 1952 and rearguments in 1953.

### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Court addressed whether segregation of white and Negro children in public schools solely on the basis of race, pursuant to state laws permitting or requiring such segregation, denies Negro children the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, even though physical facilities and other ""tangible"" factors of white and Negro schools may be equal. This directly presented whether the ""separate but equal"" doctrine from Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, applies to public education, particularly where lower courts found or were equalizing tangible factors such as buildings, curricula, transportation, and teacher qualifications.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Court unanimously held that such segregation denies Negro children equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment, as separate educational facilities are inherently unequal. Chief Justice Warren's opinion reasoned that the history of the Fourteenth Amendment is inconclusive regarding public education, given its limited development in 1868 (e.g., nonexistent Negro education in the South, rudimentary Northern systems), requiring consideration of education's modern central role in American life as a right available on equal terms where states provide it, essential for citizenship, cultural awakening, professional training, and life success. Segregation itself deprives minority children of equal educational opportunities by generating a feeling of inferiority affecting their hearts and minds, supported by district court findings (e.g., Kansas: 98 F. Supp. 797; Delaware: 87 A. 2d 862, 865) and modern social science (e.g., K.B. Clark; Witmer and Kotinsky; Deutscher and Chein). Intangible qualities from graduate school cases (Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629; McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, 339 U.S. 637) apply more forcefully to children. Plessy v. Ferguson has no place in public education; contrary language is rejected. The disposition rendered unnecessary discussion of Due Process. Due to class action status, wide applicability, and local variations, the cases were restored to the docket for further argument on decree formulation (per reargument questions 4 and 5, 345 U.S. 972), inviting participation by the U.S. Attorney General and state Attorneys General. The precedent is that racial segregation in public schools violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
Facts of the case
This case was the consolidation of cases arising in Kansas, South Carolina, Virginia, Delaware, and Washington D.C. relating to the segregation of public schools on the basis of race. In each of the cases, African American students had been denied admittance to certain public schools based on laws allowing public education to be segregated by race. They argued that such segregation violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The plaintiffs were denied relief in the lower courts based on Plessy v. Ferguson, which held that racially segregated public facilities were legal so long as the facilities for blacks and whites were equal. (This was known as the “separate but equal” doctrine.) 

Question
Does the segregation of public education based solely on race violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?

Conclusion
Separate but equal educational facilities for racial minorities is inherently unequal, violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Chief Justice Earl Warren delivered the opinion of the unanimous Court. The Supreme Court held that “separate but equal” facilities are inherently unequal and violate the protections of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court reasoned that the segregation of public education based on race instilled a sense of inferiority that had a hugely detrimental effect on the education and personal growth of African American children. Warren based much of his opinion on information from social science studies rather than court precedent. The decision also used language that was relatively accessible to non-lawyers because Warren felt it was necessary for all Americans to understand its logic. 

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
### Summary of Brown v. Board of Education

#### 1. **Facts of the Case**
The case of Brown v. Board of Education consolidated four separate cases from Kansas, South Carolina, Virginia, and Delaware, all challenging the constitutionality of segregation in public schools. The plaintiffs, African American children and their families, argued that state laws requiring or permitting segregation in public education denied them the equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment. The cases originated in different contexts: in Kansas, the Topeka Board of Education chose to segregate elementary schools despite other schools being integrated; in South Carolina and Virginia, state constitutions and laws mandated segregation; and in Delaware, while segregation was mandated, the state's courts ordered the immediate admission of African American children to white schools due to the inferiority of the African American schools. The lower courts generally relied on the ""separate but equal"" doctrine established by Plessy v. Ferguson (163 U.S. 537), except in Delaware where the courts ruled in favor of the plaintiffs.

#### 2. **Legal Question(s)**
The central legal question addressed by the Supreme Court was whether segregation of children in public schools solely on the basis of race, even if the physical facilities and other tangible factors are equal, deprives the minority children of equal educational opportunities and thus violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

#### 3. **Conclusion/Holding**
The Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision delivered by Chief Justice Warren, held that segregation in public education based solely on race is unconstitutional because it deprives African American children of equal educational opportunities. The Court concluded that the ""separate but equal"" doctrine has no place in public education, as separate educational facilities are inherently unequal. The decision was based on the understanding that modern public education is crucial for individuals and society, and segregation has a detrimental effect on African American children, generating feelings of inferiority that can affect their educational and mental development. The Court rejected the notion that the history of the Fourteenth Amendment's adoption provided a clear answer to the question, instead considering the current context and importance of public education. The cases were restored to the docket for further argument on the appropriate relief, inviting the parties and other interested states to present further arguments on how to implement the decision.

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
Facts of the case
Sergeant Muldrow, initially assigned to the Intelligence Division where she worked on various high-profile cases and was deputized by the FBI, was transferred to the Fifth District by Interim Police Commissioner Lawrence O'Toole's appointee, Captain Deeba. This change led to a different work schedule, responsibilities, and loss of special FBI-related privileges including a potential $17,500 in annual overtime pay. After her transfer, Sergeant Muldrow was asked to return FBI-issued equipment, which she did, and her Task Force Officer status was revoked. She filed a discrimination charge with the Missouri Commission on Human Rights against the City of St. Louis and Captain Deeba, later filing an action in Missouri state court alleging Title VII violations.

The case was removed to federal court, where the district court granted summary judgment against her Title VII claims and dismissed her state law claims. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed, holding that the employment decisions she alleged did not constitute “adverse employment action” and thus did not establish a prima facie case of gender discrimination under Title VII, nor were they “materially adverse action” as required for a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII.

Question
Does Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibit discrimination in transfer decisions absent a separate court determination that the transfer decision caused a signification disadvantage?

Conclusion
An employee challenging a job transfer under Title VII must show that the transfer brought about some harm with respect to an identifiable term or condition of employment, but that harm need not be significant. Although the judgment vacating and remanding the case was unanimous, Justice Elena Kagan authored the majority opinion of the Court, which was joined by five other Justices.

Nothing in Title VII’s text requires a transferred employee to show that the harm they suffered was “significant.” Rather, as long as the transfer left the employee worse off in some way with respect to their employment terms or conditions, and was made because of a protected characteristic like sex or race, it violates Title VII’s prohibition on discrimination. There is no basis for reading a heightened “significant harm” standard into the statute. Title VII targets employment practices that treat a person worse because of a protected trait, without distinguishing between significant and less significant harms. While concerns about frivolous lawsuits are valid, courts have other ways to dismiss meritless claims without imposing an extra-textual ""significant harm"" requirement.

Justice Clarence Thomas authored an opinion concurring in the judgment suggesting that the majority misinterpreted the opinion by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, below. Justice Thomas argued that the appeals court’s language requiring “a tangible change in working conditions that produces a material employment disadvantage” is not a heightened-harm requirement.

Justice Samuel Alito authored an opinion concurring in the judgment criticizing the majority for failing to clarify the degree of harm required under Title VII, arguing that there is “little if any substantive difference between the terminology the Court approves and the terminology it doesn’t like.”

Justice Brett Kavanaugh authored an opinion concurring in the judgment, arguing that while he agrees with the majority in rejecting the “significant employment disadvantage” requirement, he disagrees with its new standard requiring “some harm.” Justice Kavanaugh provided an example of a situation that clearly violates Title VII but may not satisfy the majority’s “some harm” requirement: “We are transferring you to the Cincinnati office because you are black. But your compensation will not change.” Any transfer on a discriminatory basis—no matter how quantifiable the harm—should be a violation of Title VII.

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
Here is a summary of the Supreme Court's opinion in *Muldrow v. City of St. Louis, Missouri, et al.*:

### 1. Facts of the Case

Sergeant Jatonya Clayborn Muldrow worked as a plainclothes officer in the St. Louis Police Department's Intelligence Division from 2008 to 2017. In 2017, the new commander of the Intelligence Division requested Muldrow's transfer so he could replace her with a male officer. Despite Muldrow's objections, the Department approved the transfer, reassigning her to a uniformed position elsewhere. While her rank and pay remained the same, her responsibilities, perks, and schedule changed significantly. She no longer worked with high-ranking officials on departmental priorities but instead supervised neighborhood patrol officers. She also lost access to an unmarked take-home vehicle and had a less regular schedule that included weekend shifts.

Muldrow filed a lawsuit against the City of St. Louis under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, alleging that the transfer constituted sex discrimination with respect to the terms or conditions of her employment. The District Court granted summary judgment to the City, and the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. The Eighth Circuit held that Muldrow had to demonstrate a ""materially significant disadvantage"" resulting from the transfer, which she failed to do, as her title, salary, and benefits did not decrease, and the changes in her working conditions were considered minor. Muldrow petitioned the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to address a split among the Circuit Courts regarding the required level of harm for a Title VII transfer claim.

### 2. Legal Question(s)

The primary legal question before the Supreme Court was:

*   Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, must an employee challenging a job transfer based on sex discrimination demonstrate that the transfer caused a ""significant"" or ""materially adverse"" disadvantage, or is a lesser showing of harm sufficient?

### 3. Conclusion/Holding

The Supreme Court held that an employee challenging a job transfer under Title VII must show that the transfer brought about some harm with respect to an identifiable term or condition of employment, but that harm **need not be significant**.

The Court reasoned that Title VII, 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(a)(1), prohibits employers from discriminating against any individual ""with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s . . . sex."" The Court clarified that ""discriminate against"" means to ""treat worse"" and that this treatment must be ""with respect to"" the ""terms [or] conditions"" of employment. While this requires showing a ""disadvantageous"" change, the statutory text does not impose a heightened threshold of ""significance"" or ""materiality."" The Court rejected the City's arguments based on statutory text (ejusdem generis), precedent (distinguishing *Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White*, 548 U. S. 53, which applied a ""materially adverse"" standard to the anti-retaliation provision), and policy concerns about increased litigation.

The Court vacated the Eighth Circuit's judgment, finding that it applied the wrong standard by requiring Muldrow to show a ""significant"" disadvantage. The Court stated that Muldrow need only show some injury respecting her employment terms or conditions, and her allegations, if properly preserved and supported, met this less stringent test. The Court remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with its opinion, allowing the lower courts to address issues of forfeiture and proof under the correct Title VII standard.

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
### 1. Facts of the Case
Sergeant Jatonya Clayborn Muldrow, a plainclothes officer in the St. Louis Police Department's Intelligence Division from 2008 to 2017, investigated public corruption and human trafficking cases, oversaw the Gang Unit, served as head of the Gun Crimes Unit, and was deputized as a Task Force Officer with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which provided her FBI credentials, an unmarked take-home vehicle, and authority to pursue investigations outside St. Louis. In 2017, the new Intelligence Division commander, Captain Michael Deeba, requested Muldrow's transfer to replace her with a male officer, referring to her as ""Mrs."" rather than ""Sergeant"" and testifying that the male officer was a better fit for the Division's ""very dangerous"" work. The Department approved the involuntary transfer over Muldrow's objections, reassigning her to a uniformed supervisory position in the Fifth District. Her rank and pay remained unchanged, but her responsibilities shifted from working with high-ranking officials on departmental priorities to supervising neighborhood patrol officers' day-to-day activities (including approving arrests, reviewing reports, and handling administrative matters, with some patrol work herself); she lost her FBI deputization and take-home vehicle; and her schedule changed from a regular Monday-through-Friday week to a rotating schedule often involving weekend shifts. Muldrow filed suit against the City of St. Louis, Missouri, and others under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §2000e–2(a)(1), alleging sex discrimination with respect to the terms or conditions of her employment. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri granted summary judgment to the City (2020 WL 5505113), holding that Muldrow failed to show a ""significant"" change producing ""material employment disadvantage"" under Circuit precedent. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed (30 F. 4th 680), concluding the transfer caused no ""materially significant disadvantage"" as it involved no change in title, salary, or benefits and only ""minor changes in working conditions,"" with Muldrow retaining a supervisory role involving serious crime investigations. The Supreme Court granted certiorari (600 U.S. ___ (2023)) to resolve a Circuit split on whether Title VII transfer claims require a heightened harm threshold.

### 2. Legal Question(s)
Whether, to prevail on a Title VII discrimination claim challenging an involuntary job transfer under 42 U.S.C. §2000e–2(a)(1)—which makes it unlawful to ""discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s . . . sex""—an employee must demonstrate that the transfer caused a ""significant,"" ""material,"" ""serious,"" or similarly heightened level of harm or disadvantage to an identifiable term or condition of employment, beyond merely showing some injurious or disadvantageous change in such a term or condition.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Supreme Court vacated the Eighth Circuit's judgment and remanded in a 6-3 decision (No. 22–193, decided April 17, 2024; cite as 601 U.S. ____ (2024)), with Justice Kagan writing for the Court (joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Sotomayor, Gorsuch, Barrett, and Jackson); Justices Thomas, Alito, and Kavanaugh each filed separate opinions concurring in the judgment. The Court held that a Title VII plaintiff challenging a discriminatory job transfer must show some harm or injurious change respecting an identifiable term or condition of employment (e.g., responsibilities, perks, or schedule), but need not meet any heightened ""significance,"" ""materiality,"" or similar threshold, as such a requirement adds words to the statutory text. The Court reasoned that §2000e–2(a)(1)'s prohibition on ""discriminat[ing] against"" an individual ""with respect to"" employment ""terms [or] conditions"" because of sex (citing Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 80 (1998); Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644, 657, 658, 681 (2020); Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 64 (1986)) requires only ""differences in treatment that injure"" employees tied to such terms or conditions, without textual support for an elevated harm bar that could exclude non-""significant"" injuries. The Court rejected the City's ejusdem generis argument (comparing ""fail or refuse to hire,"" ""discharge,"" or ""otherwise . . . discriminate against""), noting the provision's parts share the trait of being employment actions rather than requiring equivalent harm levels. It distinguished Burlington Northern & Santa Fe R. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 63, 68 (2006), which imposed a ""materially adverse"" (significant harm) standard for Title VII's separate anti-retaliation provision (§2000e–3(a)) to deter only actions dissuading reasonable workers from filing charges—a rationale inapplicable to the anti-discrimination provision's flat prevention of status-based injury. Policy concerns about flooding courts were dismissed, as courts can filter meritless claims via requirements of injury to terms/conditions, discriminatory intent (""because of"" sex), forfeiture, and proof; Congress could have added a significance limit if desired (citing EEOC v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc., 575 U.S. 768, 774 (2015)). Muldrow's allegations—if properly preserved and proven—satisfied the correct standard, as the transfer worsened her terms/conditions in multiple ways (e.g., from plainclothes Intelligence Division role with priority investigations, networking, regular schedule, and take-home vehicle to uniformed patrol supervision with administrative focus, irregular weekends, and lost vehicle), regardless of unchanged rank/pay. Issues of forfeiture (e.g., District Court's note that Muldrow did not argue schedule/vehicle changes against summary judgment; 2020 WL 5505113, *9, n.20) and evidentiary support were left for remand under the proper standard. The decision rejected heightened-harm precedents in Circuits including the Eighth (e.g., 30 F. 4th 680), First, Second, Fourth, Seventh, Tenth, and Eleventh, aligning with the D.C. Circuit's en banc ruling in Chambers v. District of Columbia, 35 F. 4th 870 (2022).

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
Facts of the case
Sergeant Muldrow, initially assigned to the Intelligence Division where she worked on various high-profile cases and was deputized by the FBI, was transferred to the Fifth District by Interim Police Commissioner Lawrence O'Toole's appointee, Captain Deeba. This change led to a different work schedule, responsibilities, and loss of special FBI-related privileges including a potential $17,500 in annual overtime pay. After her transfer, Sergeant Muldrow was asked to return FBI-issued equipment, which she did, and her Task Force Officer status was revoked. She filed a discrimination charge with the Missouri Commission on Human Rights against the City of St. Louis and Captain Deeba, later filing an action in Missouri state court alleging Title VII violations.

The case was removed to federal court, where the district court granted summary judgment against her Title VII claims and dismissed her state law claims. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed, holding that the employment decisions she alleged did not constitute “adverse employment action” and thus did not establish a prima facie case of gender discrimination under Title VII, nor were they “materially adverse action” as required for a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII.

Question
Does Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibit discrimination in transfer decisions absent a separate court determination that the transfer decision caused a signification disadvantage?

Conclusion
An employee challenging a job transfer under Title VII must show that the transfer brought about some harm with respect to an identifiable term or condition of employment, but that harm need not be significant. Although the judgment vacating and remanding the case was unanimous, Justice Elena Kagan authored the majority opinion of the Court, which was joined by five other Justices.

Nothing in Title VII’s text requires a transferred employee to show that the harm they suffered was “significant.” Rather, as long as the transfer left the employee worse off in some way with respect to their employment terms or conditions, and was made because of a protected characteristic like sex or race, it violates Title VII’s prohibition on discrimination. There is no basis for reading a heightened “significant harm” standard into the statute. Title VII targets employment practices that treat a person worse because of a protected trait, without distinguishing between significant and less significant harms. While concerns about frivolous lawsuits are valid, courts have other ways to dismiss meritless claims without imposing an extra-textual ""significant harm"" requirement.

Justice Clarence Thomas authored an opinion concurring in the judgment suggesting that the majority misinterpreted the opinion by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, below. Justice Thomas argued that the appeals court’s language requiring “a tangible change in working conditions that produces a material employment disadvantage” is not a heightened-harm requirement.

Justice Samuel Alito authored an opinion concurring in the judgment criticizing the majority for failing to clarify the degree of harm required under Title VII, arguing that there is “little if any substantive difference between the terminology the Court approves and the terminology it doesn’t like.”

Justice Brett Kavanaugh authored an opinion concurring in the judgment, arguing that while he agrees with the majority in rejecting the “significant employment disadvantage” requirement, he disagrees with its new standard requiring “some harm.” Justice Kavanaugh provided an example of a situation that clearly violates Title VII but may not satisfy the majority’s “some harm” requirement: “We are transferring you to the Cincinnati office because you are black. But your compensation will not change.” Any transfer on a discriminatory basis—no matter how quantifiable the harm—should be a violation of Title VII.

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
### Summary of Muldrow v. City of St. Louis, Missouri, et al.

#### 1. Facts of the Case
Sergeant Jatonya Clayborn Muldrow, a female police officer with the St. Louis Police Department, was transferred from her position as a plainclothes officer in the Intelligence Division to a uniformed job in the Fifth District. The transfer was initiated by the new Intelligence Division commander, Captain Michael Deeba, who wanted to replace Muldrow with a male officer. Although Muldrow's rank and pay remained the same, her responsibilities, perks, and schedule changed significantly. She lost her FBI Task Force Officer status, her unmarked take-home vehicle, and her regular Monday-to-Friday schedule, and was instead given a rotating schedule that often involved weekend shifts. Muldrow brought a Title VII suit against the City of St. Louis, alleging that the transfer was discriminatory and affected the ""terms [or] conditions"" of her employment.

#### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Supreme Court addressed the specific legal question of whether an employee challenging a job transfer under Title VII must show that the transfer caused a ""significant"" or ""materially significant disadvantage."" The Court examined the statutory language of Title VII, specifically 42 U.S.C. §2000e–2(a)(1), which prohibits employers from discriminating against employees ""with respect to"" the ""terms [or] conditions"" of employment because of their sex or other protected trait.

#### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Supreme Court held that an employee challenging a job transfer under Title VII must show that the transfer brought about some harm with respect to an identifiable term or condition of employment, but that harm need not be significant. The Court rejected the ""significance"" standard applied by the lower courts, finding that it added a requirement not present in the statutory text. The Court vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with its holding. The Court's decision establishes that a plaintiff must show some injury respecting their employment terms or conditions, but does not need to meet a heightened threshold of harm. Muldrow's allegations, if properly preserved and supported, meet this test, as she was allegedly transferred because of her sex and suffered changes to her job responsibilities, schedule, and perks.

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
Facts of the case
Citizens United sought an injunction against the Federal Election Commission in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to prevent the application of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) to its film Hillary: The Movie. The Movie expressed opinions about whether Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton would make a good president.

In an attempt to regulate ""big money"" campaign contributions, the BCRA applies a variety of restrictions to ""electioneering communications."" Section 203 of the BCRA prevents corporations or labor unions from funding such communication from their general treasuries. Sections 201 and 311 require the disclosure of donors to such communication and a disclaimer when the communication is not authorized by the candidate it intends to support.

Citizens United argued that: 1) Section 203 violates the First Amendment on its face and when applied to The Movie and its related advertisements, and that 2) Sections 201 and 203 are also unconstitutional as applied to the circumstances.

The United States District Court denied the injunction. Section 203 on its face was not unconstitutional because the Supreme Court in McConnell v. FEC had already reached that determination. The District Court also held that The Movie was the functional equivalent of express advocacy, as it attempted to inform voters that Senator Clinton was unfit for office, and thus Section 203 was not unconstitutionally applied. Lastly, it held that Sections 201 and 203 were not unconstitutional as applied to the The Movie or its advertisements. The court reasoned that the McConnell decision recognized that disclosure of donors ""might be unconstitutional if it imposed an unconstitutional burden on the freedom to associate in support of a particular cause,"" but those circumstances did not exist in Citizen United's claim.

Question
1) Did the Supreme Court's decision in McConnell resolve all constitutional as-applied challenges to the BCRA when it upheld the disclosure requirements of the statute as constitutional?

2) Do the BCRA's disclosure requirements impose an unconstitutional burden when applied to electioneering requirements because they are protected ""political speech"" and not subject to regulation as ""campaign speech""?

3) If a communication lacks a clear plea to vote for or against a particular candidate, is it subject to regulation under the BCRA?

4) Should a feature length documentary about a candidate for political office be treated like the advertisements at issue in McConnell and therefore be subject to regulation under the BCRA?

Conclusion
No. No. Yes. Yes. The Supreme Court overruled Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce and portions of McConnell v. FEC. (In the prior cases, the Court had held that political speech may be banned based on the speaker's corporate identity.) By a 5-to-4 vote along ideological lines, the majority held that under the First Amendment corporate funding of independent political broadcasts in candidate elections cannot be limited. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the majority joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justices Antonin G. Scalia, Samuel A. Alito, and Clarence Thomas. Justice John Paul Stevens dissented, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, and Sonia Sotomayor. The majority maintained that political speech is indispensable to a democracy, which is no less true because the speech comes from a corporation. The majority also held that the BCRA's disclosure requirements as applied to The Movie were constitutional, reasoning that disclosure is justified by a ""governmental interest"" in providing the ""electorate with information"" about election-related spending resources. The Court also upheld the disclosure requirements for political advertising sponsors and it upheld the ban on direct contributions to candidates from corporations and unions.

In a separate concurring opinion, Chief Justice Roberts, joined by Justice Alito, emphasized the care with which the Court handles constitutional issues and its attempts to avoid constitutional issues when at all possible. Here, the Court had no narrower grounds upon which to rule, except to handle the First Amendment issues embodied within the case. Justice Scalia also wrote a separate concurring opinion, joined by Justices Alito and Thomas in part, criticizing Justice Stevens' understanding of the Framer's view towards corporations. Justice Stevens argued that corporations are not members of society and that there are compelling governmental interests to curb corporations' ability to spend money during local and national elections.

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
Here is a summary of the Supreme Court's decision in *Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission*:

### 1. Facts of the Case

Citizens United, a non-profit corporation, produced a film titled *Hillary: The Movie* that was critical of then-Senator Hillary Clinton, a candidate for the 2008 Presidential nomination. Citizens United intended to make the film available through video-on-demand within 30 days of primary elections and produced television advertisements to promote it.

Under Section 441b of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), corporations and unions are prohibited from using their general treasury funds for ""independent expenditures"" for speech that constitutes an ""electioneering communication"" or expressly advocates for the election or defeat of a candidate. An ""electioneering communication"" is defined as a broadcast, cable, or satellite communication that refers to a clearly identified candidate and is made within a specific timeframe before an election.

Citizens United sought declaratory and injunctive relief, arguing that Section 441b was unconstitutional as applied to their film and advertisements. They also challenged BCRA's disclaimer, disclosure, and reporting requirements as applied to their materials. The District Court denied Citizens United's request for an injunction and granted summary judgment to the Federal Election Commission (FEC). Citizens United appealed this decision to the Supreme Court.

### 2. Legal Question(s)

The Supreme Court addressed several legal questions, including:

*   Whether Section 441b of BCRA, which prohibits corporations and unions from using their general treasury funds for independent expenditures on electioneering communications or express advocacy, is constitutional.
*   Specifically, whether the prohibition on corporate independent expenditures violates the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech.
*   Whether the precedent set in *Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce* (1990), which allowed for restrictions on corporate political speech based on the speaker's corporate identity, should be upheld or overruled.
*   Whether BCRA's disclaimer, disclosure, and reporting requirements are constitutional as applied to Citizens United's film and advertisements.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding

The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, **overruled** *Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce* and held that Section 441b's restrictions on independent expenditures by corporations and unions are **unconstitutional**. The Court reasoned that the First Amendment protects political speech regardless of the speaker's corporate identity.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Corporate Speech is Protected Speech:** The Court reaffirmed that the First Amendment protects speech by corporations. It rejected the idea that the government can ban political speech based on the speaker's corporate identity.
*   **Rejection of the ""Antidistortion"" Rationale:** The Court overruled *Austin*'s ""antidistortion"" rationale, which argued that corporate wealth could distort the political marketplace. The Court found this rationale inconsistent with First Amendment principles, stating that the First Amendment protects speech, not the speaker's financial ability to speak. The Court also noted that this rationale could lead to banning political speech by media corporations, which are currently exempt from some restrictions but possess significant wealth.
*   **Rejection of the Anticorruption Rationale for Independent Expenditures:** The Court held that independent expenditures, unlike direct contributions to candidates, do not give rise to *quid pro quo* corruption or the appearance thereof. Therefore, the government's interest in preventing corruption is not a sufficient justification for banning corporate independent expenditures.
*   **Shareholder Protection Not a Basis for Banning Speech:** The Court found that the interest in protecting shareholders from being compelled to fund corporate political speech was not a sufficient basis to ban such speech, as shareholders have other avenues to voice their dissent and the statute was both underinclusive and overinclusive in addressing this concern.
*   **Disclaimer and Disclosure Requirements Upheld:** The Court affirmed the constitutionality of BCRA's disclaimer and disclosure requirements. It reasoned that these requirements do not prevent speech but rather provide information to the electorate about the sources of election-related spending, which is a sufficiently important governmental interest. The Court found that Citizens United had not demonstrated that these requirements would subject its donors to threats or reprisals.

**Precedent Set:**

The decision in *Citizens United* significantly altered campaign finance law by holding that the government cannot prohibit corporations and unions from making independent expenditures for political speech. This ruling effectively struck down key provisions of BCRA that restricted such spending and overturned the precedent established in *Austin*. The Court returned to the principle that the First Amendment protects political speech based on its content, not the identity of the speaker.

Justice Stevens argued that corporations are not members of society and that there are compelling governmental interests to curb corporations' ability to spend money during local and national elections.

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
### 1. Facts of the Case
Citizens United, a nonprofit corporation with an annual budget of about $12 million funded mostly by individual donations and a small portion from for-profit corporations, produced a 90-minute documentary film entitled *Hillary: The Movie* (referred to as *Hillary*), which was critical of then-Senator Hillary Clinton, a candidate for her party's 2008 presidential nomination. Citizens United sought to make *Hillary* available on cable television through video-on-demand within 30 days of primary elections and produced television ads (two 10-second and one 30-second) to promote it on broadcast and cable television. Anticipating civil and criminal penalties under 2 U.S.C. § 441b (as amended by § 203 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA)), which prohibits corporations and unions from using general treasury funds for ""electioneering communications"" or speech expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate, Citizens United filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. It argued that § 441b was unconstitutional as applied to *Hillary* and the ads, and that BCRA §§ 201 and 311 (disclosure and disclaimer requirements) were unconstitutional as applied to *Hillary* and the ads. A three-judge district court denied Citizens United's motion for a preliminary injunction, 530 F. Supp. 2d 274 (D.D.C. 2008) (*per curiam*), and granted summary judgment to the Federal Election Commission (FEC), App. 261a–262a. Citizens United appealed directly to the Supreme Court under BCRA § 403(a).

### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Court addressed: (1) whether 2 U.S.C. § 441b (as amended by BCRA § 203) is facially valid under the First Amendment or unconstitutional as applied to *Hillary* and the ads promoting it, including whether the Court should overrule *Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce*, 494 U.S. 652 (1990) (upholding restrictions on corporate independent expenditures based on corporate identity), and the part of *McConnell v. Federal Election Comm'n*, 540 U.S. 93, 203–209 (2003), upholding BCRA § 203's extension of § 441b; (2) whether narrower grounds resolved the case without overruling *Austin*, such as whether *Hillary* qualifies as an ""electioneering communication"" under § 441b(b)(2) and 11 C.F.R. § 100.29, whether § 441b applies under *Federal Election Comm'n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.*, 551 U.S. 449 (2007) (*WRTL*), whether video-on-demand poses less risk of distortion than television ads, or whether a nonprofit corporate exception applies; and (3) whether BCRA §§ 201 and 311 (disclosure and disclaimer requirements) are constitutional as applied to *Hillary* and the ads.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Court (in a 5-4 opinion by Justice Kennedy, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Scalia and Alito; Justice Thomas joined all but Part IV) held that § 441b's prohibitions on corporate and union independent expenditures for electioneering communications or express advocacy are facially invalid under the First Amendment and overruled *Austin* and the relevant part of *McConnell* upholding BCRA § 203. Political speech is central to the First Amendment and subject to strict scrutiny, requiring the Government to prove a restriction furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored; no such interest justifies suppressing corporate political speech based on speaker identity. The Court rejected narrower grounds as unsustainable and found resolving the case without facial review would chill speech due to § 441b's complexity and the need for prior FEC permission. *Austin*'s ""antidistortion"" rationale (preventing distorting effects of corporate wealth) was rejected as inconsistent with First Amendment protections for corporate speech (*e.g.*, *First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti*, 435 U.S. 765 (1978); *Buckley v. Valeo*, 424 U.S. 1 (1976) (*per curiam*)); independent expenditures do not corrupt or appear to corrupt (*Buckley*, 424 U.S. at 47); shareholder protection and foreign influence interests were under- and overinclusive; *stare decisis* factors (antiquity, reliance, workability) favored overruling *Austin*. PACs do not alleviate § 441b's burdens. The Court upheld BCRA §§ 201 and 311 as applied to the ads and *Hillary* under exacting scrutiny, as they impose no ceiling on speech and advance a sufficiently important informational interest without evidence of threats or harassment to Citizens United's donors (*Buckley*, 424 U.S. at 66, 76; *McConnell*, 540 U.S. at 196). Judgment reversed in part, affirmed in part, and remanded. Precedent: Corporations and unions may make unlimited independent expenditures from general treasury funds; overrules *Austin* and *McConnell* on corporate/union independent expenditures; upholds disclosure/disclaimer requirements.

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
Facts of the case
Citizens United sought an injunction against the Federal Election Commission in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to prevent the application of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) to its film Hillary: The Movie. The Movie expressed opinions about whether Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton would make a good president.

In an attempt to regulate ""big money"" campaign contributions, the BCRA applies a variety of restrictions to ""electioneering communications."" Section 203 of the BCRA prevents corporations or labor unions from funding such communication from their general treasuries. Sections 201 and 311 require the disclosure of donors to such communication and a disclaimer when the communication is not authorized by the candidate it intends to support.

Citizens United argued that: 1) Section 203 violates the First Amendment on its face and when applied to The Movie and its related advertisements, and that 2) Sections 201 and 203 are also unconstitutional as applied to the circumstances.

The United States District Court denied the injunction. Section 203 on its face was not unconstitutional because the Supreme Court in McConnell v. FEC had already reached that determination. The District Court also held that The Movie was the functional equivalent of express advocacy, as it attempted to inform voters that Senator Clinton was unfit for office, and thus Section 203 was not unconstitutionally applied. Lastly, it held that Sections 201 and 203 were not unconstitutional as applied to the The Movie or its advertisements. The court reasoned that the McConnell decision recognized that disclosure of donors ""might be unconstitutional if it imposed an unconstitutional burden on the freedom to associate in support of a particular cause,"" but those circumstances did not exist in Citizen United's claim.

Question
1) Did the Supreme Court's decision in McConnell resolve all constitutional as-applied challenges to the BCRA when it upheld the disclosure requirements of the statute as constitutional?

2) Do the BCRA's disclosure requirements impose an unconstitutional burden when applied to electioneering requirements because they are protected ""political speech"" and not subject to regulation as ""campaign speech""?

3) If a communication lacks a clear plea to vote for or against a particular candidate, is it subject to regulation under the BCRA?

4) Should a feature length documentary about a candidate for political office be treated like the advertisements at issue in McConnell and therefore be subject to regulation under the BCRA?

Conclusion
No. No. Yes. Yes. The Supreme Court overruled Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce and portions of McConnell v. FEC. (In the prior cases, the Court had held that political speech may be banned based on the speaker's corporate identity.) By a 5-to-4 vote along ideological lines, the majority held that under the First Amendment corporate funding of independent political broadcasts in candidate elections cannot be limited. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the majority joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justices Antonin G. Scalia, Samuel A. Alito, and Clarence Thomas. Justice John Paul Stevens dissented, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, and Sonia Sotomayor. The majority maintained that political speech is indispensable to a democracy, which is no less true because the speech comes from a corporation. The majority also held that the BCRA's disclosure requirements as applied to The Movie were constitutional, reasoning that disclosure is justified by a ""governmental interest"" in providing the ""electorate with information"" about election-related spending resources. The Court also upheld the disclosure requirements for political advertising sponsors and it upheld the ban on direct contributions to candidates from corporations and unions.

In a separate concurring opinion, Chief Justice Roberts, joined by Justice Alito, emphasized the care with which the Court handles constitutional issues and its attempts to avoid constitutional issues when at all possible. Here, the Court had no narrower grounds upon which to rule, except to handle the First Amendment issues embodied within the case. Justice Scalia also wrote a separate concurring opinion, joined by Justices Alito and Thomas in part, criticizing Justice Stevens' understanding of the Framer's view towards corporations. Justice Stevens argued that corporations are not members of society and that there are compelling governmental interests to curb corporations' ability to spend money during local and national elections.

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
### Summary of Citizens United v. FEC

#### 1. Facts of the Case
Citizens United, a non-profit corporation, produced a documentary critical of then-Senator Hillary Clinton during her 2008 presidential primary campaign. The corporation intended to make the documentary available through video-on-demand, a cable television service. However, it was concerned that doing so within 30 days of the primary elections would violate the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), specifically 2 U.S.C. §441b, which prohibits corporations and unions from using their general treasury funds to make independent expenditures for speech that is an ""electioneering communication"" or for speech that expressly advocates the election or defeat of a candidate. Citizens United sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the Federal Election Commission (FEC), arguing that §441b was unconstitutional as applied to its documentary and that BCRA's disclaimer, disclosure, and reporting requirements were unconstitutional as applied to the documentary and related advertisements.

#### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Court addressed two primary legal questions:
1. Whether the restriction on corporate independent expenditures under §441b violates the First Amendment.
2. Whether BCRA's disclaimer and disclosure requirements are constitutional as applied to Citizens United's documentary and advertisements.

#### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Supreme Court held that:
1. **§441b's restriction on corporate independent expenditures is unconstitutional.** The Court overruled Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce (1990) and the part of McConnell v. FEC (2003) that upheld BCRA §203's extension of §441b's restrictions on corporate independent expenditures. The Court found that political speech does not lose First Amendment protection simply because its source is a corporation. It rejected the antidistortion rationale and other justifications for restricting corporate political speech, concluding that such restrictions are not justified by a compelling governmental interest and are not narrowly tailored to achieve such an interest.
2. **BCRA's disclaimer and disclosure requirements are constitutional as applied to Citizens United's documentary and advertisements.** The Court applied ""exacting scrutiny"" and found that these requirements serve a sufficiently important governmental interest in providing the electorate with information about the sources of election-related spending. The Court rejected Citizens United's argument that these requirements should be limited to speech that is the functional equivalent of express advocacy.

The Court's decision effectively allows corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts from their general treasuries on independent expenditures, such as advertisements and other forms of electioneering communications, as long as they do not coordinate with candidates or their campaigns. This ruling has had significant implications for campaign finance law and the role of money in politics.

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
Facts of the case

When Google implemented its Android Operating System (Android OS), it wrote its own programming language based on Java, which is owned by Oracle. To facilitate developers writing their own programs for Android OS, Google's version used the same names, organization, and functionality as Java's Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

Oracle sued Google for copyright infringement, but the federal district judge held that APIs are not subject to copyright because permitting a private entity to own the copyright to a programming language would stifle innovation and collaboration, contrary to the goals of copyright. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the lower court, finding that the Java APIs are copyrightable but leaving open the possibility of a fair use defense. The U.S. Supreme Court denied Google's petition for certiorari.

Upon remand to the district court, a jury found that Google's use of the Java API was fair use. Oracle appealed, and the Federal Circuit again reversed the lower court. The Federal Circuit held that Google's use was not fair as a matter of law.

Question
1. Does copyright protection extend to a software interface? 
2. If so, does the petitioner's use of a software interface in the context of creating a new computer program constitute fair use?

Conclusion
Assuming a software interface may be subject to copyright protection, Google's limited copying of the Java SE Application Programming Interface constituted a fair use of that material under copyright law. Justice Stephen Breyer authored the 6-2 majority opinion.

Copyright law aims to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by simultaneously granting creators exclusive copyrights and limiting the scope of such rights through the fair use doctrine. To decide no more than necessary to resolve the case, the Court assumed that software code is subject to copyright protection.

Courts consider four statutory factors in evaluating whether a secondary use is fair. First, Google's use of the Java APIs is transformative. Google copied only what was necessary to allow programmers to work in a different computing environment but with a familiar programming language. Second, the copied lines are ""inherently bound together with uncopyrightable ideas,"" suggesting that the application of fair use to this context is unlikely to undermine the general copyright protection that Congress provided for computer programs. Third, Google copied only .4% of the entire API, weighing in favor of fair use. Finally, the record shows that Google's new smartphone platform is not a market substitute for Java SE. Because all four factors support a finding of fair use, Google's limited copying constituted fair use.

Justice Clarence Thomas authored a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Samuel Alito joined, arguing that the Court should have addressed the question whether Oracle's code is copyrightable. Justice Thomas would have concluded that it is, and then he would have found that Google's use of that copyrighted code was not fair. By copying Oracle's code, Google ""erased 97.5% of the value of Oracle's partnership with Amazon, made tens of billions of dollars, and established its position as the owner of the largest mobile operating system in the world.""

Justice Amy Coney Barrett took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.


## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
Here is a summary of the Supreme Court's opinion in *Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc.*:

### 1. Facts of the Case

Oracle America, Inc. (Oracle) owned the copyright to Java SE, a computer platform utilizing the Java programming language. In 2005, Google acquired Android and sought to develop a new software platform for mobile devices. To facilitate adoption by the millions of programmers familiar with Java, Google copied approximately 11,500 lines of code from Java SE's Application Programming Interface (API). These copied lines were part of the ""declaring code"" within the API, which allows programmers to call prewritten computing tasks.

This case has a lengthy history through the lower courts. Initially, the courts considered whether the copied lines were copyrightable and, if so, whether Google's use constituted ""fair use."" The Federal Circuit held that the copied lines were copyrightable. Subsequently, a jury found that Google's use was a fair use. However, the Federal Circuit reversed this finding, ruling as a matter of law that Google's copying was not fair use. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the Federal Circuit's determinations on both copyrightability and fair use.

### 2. Legal Question(s)

The Supreme Court addressed two primary legal questions:
1.  Is the declaring code within the Java SE API copyrightable?
2.  If the declaring code is copyrightable, did Google's copying of this code constitute a ""fair use"" under the Copyright Act, thereby excusing it from liability for copyright infringement?

The Court explicitly stated that to resolve the case, it would *assume* for argument's sake that the copied lines were copyrightable and focus its analysis on the fair use question.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding

The Supreme Court held that Google's copying of the Java SE API, specifically the declaring code, was a fair use as a matter of law. The Court reversed the judgment of the Federal Circuit.

The Court's reasoning centered on an analysis of the four statutory fair use factors:

*   **Nature of the Copyrighted Work:** The Court found this factor weighed in favor of fair use. It noted that the declaring code, as part of a user interface, is ""inextricably bound"" with uncopyrightable ideas (task organization) and new creative expression (Google's implementing code). The value of this code also derives significantly from the investment of programmers who learn it, rather than solely from the copyright holder's creativity. This nature, the Court reasoned, places it further from the ""core of copyright"" than many other computer programs.
*   **Purpose and Character of the Use:** The Court determined that Google's use was ""transformative."" Google copied only what was necessary to allow programmers familiar with Java to work in the new Android smartphone environment without having to learn an entirely new system. This facilitated the creation of a new platform (Android) for a different computing environment, which the Court viewed as consistent with copyright's constitutional objective to promote progress.
*   **Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used:** While Google copied a significant amount of declaring code (11,500 lines), the Court considered this in relation to the entire API (2.86 million lines), finding the copied portion to be a small percentage. More importantly, the Court reasoned that the copying was ""tethered to a valid, and transformative, purpose."" Google copied the declaring code not for its inherent creativity but because it was necessary to unlock programmers' existing skills for the new platform.
*   **Effect of the Use Upon the Potential Market:** The Court found this factor also weighed in favor of fair use. The evidence suggested that Google's Android platform was not a market substitute for Java SE. Furthermore, the Court noted that Sun (Oracle's predecessor) had business challenges in the mobile market and that the reimplementation of its API might even benefit the broader Java ecosystem by expanding the network of Java-trained programmers. The Court also expressed concern that enforcing copyright on such interfaces could harm public creativity by creating a ""lock"" on future innovation.

The Court concluded that, when applied to the functional nature of computer programs and the specific context of reimplementing a user interface to enable programmers to use their existing skills in a new and transformative program, Google's copying constituted fair use. The Court emphasized that its decision did not alter existing fair use precedent but rather applied those principles to the unique circumstances of computer software.

### Summary of Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc.

#### 1. Facts of the Case
Google acquired Android, Inc. in 2005 and sought to develop a software platform for mobile devices. To attract programmers familiar with the Java programming language, Google copied approximately 11,500 lines of code from Oracle's Java SE program, which is part of an Application Programming Interface (API).

The Federal Circuit held that the copied lines were copyrightable, and after a jury found for Google on fair use, the Federal Circuit reversed, concluding that Google's copying was not fair use as a matter of law.

#### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Supreme Court addressed whether Google's copying of the Java SE API constituted fair use under the Copyright Act. Specifically, the Court examined the four statutory factors for determining fair use: (1) the purpose and character of the use, (2) the nature of the copyrighted work, (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used, and (4) the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

#### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Supreme Court held that Google's copying of the Java SE API was a fair use as a matter of law. The Court assumed, without deciding, that the API was copyrightable and focused on the fair use analysis. The Court concluded that Google's use was transformative because it allowed programmers to work in a new computing environment (smartphones) without having to learn a new programming system. The Court also found that the nature of the copyrighted work (the API) favored fair use because it was inherently bound with uncopyrightable ideas and was designed to be used by programmers. The amount copied was considered substantial in absolute terms but small relative to the entire Java SE program. The Court determined that the fourth factor (market effects) also favored fair use because Google's Android platform was not a market substitute for Java SE, and enforcing Oracle's copyright could harm the public by limiting future creativity.

The Court's reasoning emphasized the importance of fair use in promoting creativity and innovation, particularly in the context of computer programs. The decision reversed the Federal Circuit's judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings. Justice Thomas dissented, arguing that the declaring code was copyrightable and that Google's use was not fair.

By copying Oracle's code, Google ""erased 97.5% of the value of Oracle's partnership with Amazon, made tens of billions of dollars, and established its position as the owner of the largest mobile operating system in the world.""

Justice Amy Coney Barrett took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.


## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
### 1. Facts of the Case
Oracle America, Inc., the owner of a copyright in Java SE—a computer platform using the Java programming language—sued Google LLC in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in 2010, alleging copyright infringement. In 2005, Google acquired Android, Inc., and sought to develop an open software platform for mobile devices like smartphones. To attract the approximately six million programmers familiar with Java, Google copied roughly 11,500 lines of declaring code from the Java SE Application Programming Interface (API)—specifically, the declaring code and structure, sequence, and organization (SSO) for 37 packages—without permission, while writing its own implementing code (millions of lines) tailored for smartphones. This copying enabled Java programmers to use familiar method calls (e.g., ""java.lang.Math.max(4, 6)"") to invoke tasks on Android. Negotiations for a license between Google and Sun Microsystems (Oracle's predecessor) broke down due to disagreements over interoperability and openness.

Litigation proceeded in phases: A jury rejected Oracle's patent claims, found limited copyright infringement, but deadlocked on fair use; the District Court ruled the API declaring code not copyrightable under 17 U.S.C. §102(b) as a ""system or method of operation"" (Oracle America, Inc. v. Google Inc., 872 F. Supp. 2d 974 (ND Cal. 2012)). The Federal Circuit reversed, holding the declaring code and SSO copyrightable (Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc., 750 F. 3d 1339 (CA Fed. 2014)). The Supreme Court denied certiorari (Google, Inc. v. Oracle America, Inc., 576 U. S. 1071 (2015)). On remand, a jury found Google's use a fair use. The Federal Circuit reversed again, holding no fair use as a matter of law (886 F. 3d 1179 (CA Fed. 2018)), and remanded for damages. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on both copyrightability and fair use.

### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Court addressed: (1) whether the 11,500 lines of Java SE API declaring code and SSO for 37 packages are copyrightable, particularly in light of 17 U.S.C. §102(b) excluding ""any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery""; and (2) if copyrightable, whether Google's copying constituted ""fair use"" under 17 U.S.C. §107, which provides limitations on exclusive rights and directs consideration of four factors: (1) purpose and character of the use; (2) nature of the copyrighted work; (3) amount and substantiality of the portion used; and (4) effect upon the potential market or value. To decide no more than necessary, the Court assumed arguendo that the API was copyrightable and focused solely on fair use. The Court also held that fair use is a mixed question of law and fact, with underlying facts reviewed for substantial evidence but the ultimate legal question reviewed de novo, consistent with the Seventh Amendment.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Court held, 6-2, that Google's copying of the Java SE API declaring code was a fair use as a matter of law, reversing the Federal Circuit (886 F. 3d 1179) and remanding. Justice Breyer delivered the opinion, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh; Justice Barrett took no part; Justice Thomas dissented, joined by Justice Alito.

**Reasoning**: Fair use under §107 is a flexible, equitable doctrine accounting for technological changes and the functional nature of computer programs, serving as a context-based check on copyright monopolies to promote progress under Art. I, §8, cl. 8. All four factors favored fair use:

- **Nature of the work (§107(2))**: Favors fair use; the API declaring code is a user interface (not core creative expression like implementing code), inherently bound with uncopyrightable ideas (task organization), method calls, and programmer investment, unlike typical programs.
- **Purpose/character (§107(1))**: Favors fair use; transformative as Google reimplemented the interface only as needed for a new smartphone platform/environment, enabling programmers' skills in Android (a distinct, open system), furthering innovation (e.g., industry reimplementations like Sun's own); commerciality not dispositive.
- **Amount/substantiality (§107(3))**: Favors fair use; 11,500 lines (0.4% of 2.86 million total API lines) were quantitatively small relative to the whole and qualitatively tethered to the transformative purpose (compatibility for programmers), not copied for creativity.
- **Market effects (§107(4))**: Favors fair use; Android not a substitute for Java SE (desktop/laptop focus; Sun/Oracle failed in smartphones); Oracle benefited from Java ecosystem expansion; enforcement risks public harm by locking innovation (programmer lock-in).

The holding applies fair use precedents (e.g., Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U. S. 569 (1994); Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U. S. 539 (1985); Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U. S. 417 (1984)) to functional computer interfaces without overruling them, recognizing Congress's 1980 extension of copyright to programs (§101) and intent for case-by-case fair use application.

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
Facts of the case

In 2014, Roxanne Torres was involved in an incident with police officers in which she was operating a vehicle under the influence of methamphetamine and in the process of trying to get away, endangered the two officers pursuing her. In the process, one of the officers shot and injured her. Torres pleaded no contest to three crimes: (1) aggravated fleeing from a law enforcement officer, (2) assault on a police officer, and (3) unlawfully taking a motor vehicle.

In October 2016, she filed a civil-rights complaint in federal court against the two officers, alleging claims including excessive force and conspiracy to engage in excessive force. Construing Torres's complaint as asserting the excessive-force claims under the Fourth Amendment, the court concluded that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity. In the court's view, the officers had not seized Torres at the time of the shooting, and without a seizure, there could be no Fourth Amendment violation. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed.

Question
Must physical force used to detain a suspect be successful to constitute a ""seizure"" under the Fourth Amendment?

Conclusion
The application of physical force to the body of a person with intent to restrain is a seizure, even if the force does not succeed in subduing the person. Chief Justice John Roberts authored the majority opinion.

Under the Court's precedents, common law arrests are considered seizures under the Fourth Amendment, and the application of force to the body of a person with intent to restrain constitutes an arrest even if the arrestee escapes. The use of a device, here, a gun, to effect the arrest, makes no difference in the outcome; it is still a seizure. There is no reason to draw an ""artificial line"" between grasping an arrestee with a hand and using some other means of applying physical force to effect an arrest. The key consideration is whether the conduct objectively manifests the intent to restrain; subjective perceptions are irrelevant. Additionally, the requirement of intent to restrain lasts only as long as the application of force. In this case, the officers' conduct clearly manifested intent to restrain Torres and was thus a seizure under the Fourth Amendment.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.

Justice Neil Gorsuch authored a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito joined, arguing that ""neither the Constitution nor common sense"" support the majority's definition of a seizure.


## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
Here is a summary of the Supreme Court opinion in *Torres v. Madrid et al.*:

### 1. Facts of the Case

On July 15, 2014, New Mexico State Police officers Janice Madrid and Richard Williamson arrived at an Albuquerque apartment complex to execute an arrest warrant. They approached Roxanne Torres, who was standing near a Toyota FJ Cruiser. As Torres entered the driver's seat, the officers attempted to speak with her. Believing the officers to be carjackers, Torres accelerated her vehicle to escape. The officers then fired their service pistols 13 times, striking Torres twice. Despite being shot, Torres managed to drive away, eventually reaching a hospital 75 miles away. She was later airlifted to another hospital in Albuquerque, where she was arrested the following day. Torres subsequently filed a lawsuit against Officers Madrid and Williamson under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that they used excessive force and that the shooting constituted an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's grant of summary judgment to the officers, holding that a suspect's continued flight after being shot negates a Fourth Amendment excessive force claim.

### 2. Legal Question(s)

The primary legal question before the Supreme Court was: Does the application of physical force to a person's body with the intent to restrain constitute a seizure under the Fourth Amendment, even if the person does not submit to the force and is not subdued?

### 3. Conclusion/Holding

The Supreme Court held that the application of physical force to the body of a person with the intent to restrain is a seizure under the Fourth Amendment, even if the person does not submit and is not subdued.

The Court reasoned that its precedents have interpreted the term ""seizure"" by consulting the common law of arrest. In *California v. Hodari D.*, 499 U. S. 621 (1991), the Court explained that the common law considered the application of physical force to the body with the intent to restrain to be an arrest, regardless of whether the person yielded. The Court reviewed historical English and American legal decisions, confirming that the slightest touching with the intent to restrain was sufficient to complete an arrest. The Court found no basis to distinguish between a ""laying on of hands"" and other means of applying physical force, such as a bullet, to effect an arrest. The Court emphasized that the Fourth Amendment's focus is on the privacy and security of individuals, not the specific method of governmental intrusion.

The Court clarified that a seizure by force requires the use of force with the intent to restrain, not force applied accidentally or for another purpose. The objective manifestation of intent to restrain is the relevant inquiry, not the subjective motivation of the officer or the perception of the suspect. Furthermore, a seizure by force lasts only as long as the application of force, unless the suspect submits.

Applying this principle, the Court concluded that the officers seized Torres at the instant the bullets struck her, as the application of physical force objectively manifested an intent to restrain her movement. The Court vacated the Tenth Circuit's judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings, leaving open questions regarding the reasonableness of the seizure, the damages caused, and the officers' entitlement to qualified immunity.

#### 1. Facts of the Case
The case involves petitioner Roxanne Torres, who was shot by New Mexico State Police Officers Janice Madrid and Richard Williamson. The officers arrived at an Albuquerque apartment complex to execute an arrest warrant for a different individual. Torres, who was experiencing methamphetamine withdrawal, got into her car and attempted to escape, believing the officers were carjackers. The officers fired 13 shots, striking Torres twice. She managed to escape, drove 75 miles to a hospital, and was later arrested the next day upon being airlifted back to Albuquerque. Torres sought damages under 42 U.S.C. §1983, claiming the officers used excessive force and that the shooting constituted an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment.

#### 2. Legal Question(s)
The specific legal question addressed by the Court was whether the application of physical force to a person's body with the intent to restrain constitutes a seizure under the Fourth Amendment, even if the person does not submit to the authority or is not subdued.

#### 3. Conclusion/Holding

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
### 1. Facts of the Case
Petitioner Roxanne Torres sued respondents Janice Madrid and Richard Williamson, officers with the New Mexico State Police, under 42 U.S.C. §1983, alleging that they used excessive force, constituting an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment. On July 15, 2014, the officers arrived at an Albuquerque apartment complex to execute an arrest warrant for a woman accused of white-collar crimes and suspected of involvement in drug trafficking, murder, and other violent crimes. The officers observed Torres, who was experiencing methamphetamine withdrawal, standing near a Toyota FJ Cruiser. As the officers approached, Torres entered the driver's seat. Believing the officers—who wore tactical vests marked with police identification but whom she perceived only as armed carjackers—posed a threat, Torres accelerated to escape. Neither officer stood in the vehicle's path, but both fired their service pistols 13 times, striking Torres twice in the back and temporarily paralyzing her left arm. Steering with her right arm, Torres exited the complex, drove a short distance, stopped in a parking lot, asked a bystander to report an attempted carjacking, stole a nearby idling Kia Soul, and drove 75 miles to a hospital in Grants, New Mexico. She was airlifted to a hospital in Albuquerque, where police arrested her the next day. Torres pleaded no contest to aggravated fleeing from a law enforcement officer, assault on a peace officer, and unlawfully taking a motor vehicle. The District Court granted summary judgment to the officers. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed, holding that ""a suspect’s continued flight after being shot by police negates a Fourth Amendment excessive-force claim,"" relying on its precedent that ""no seizure can occur unless there is physical touch or a show of authority,"" and that ""such physical touch (or force) must terminate the suspect’s movement"" or give rise to physical control (Brooks v. Gaenzle, 614 F.3d 1213, 1223 (CA10 2010); Torres v. Madrid, 769 Fed. Appx. 654, 657 (CA10 2019)). The Supreme Court granted certiorari (589 U.S. ___ (2019)).

### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Court addressed whether the application of physical force to the body of a person with intent to restrain constitutes a Fourth Amendment seizure even if the person does not submit and is not subdued, specifically whether an officer seizes a person by shooting her if she temporarily eludes capture after the shooting. The Court examined the meaning of ""seizure"" under the Fourth Amendment by reference to the common law of arrest, distinguishing seizures effected by physical force from those by show of authority, and rejected an alternative test of intentional acquisition of physical control.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Court held that the application of physical force to the body of a person with intent to restrain is a Fourth Amendment seizure even if the person does not submit and is not subdued (Pp. 3–18). Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court, joined by Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan, and Kavanaugh. The Court reasoned that its precedents interpret ""seizure"" by consulting the common law of arrest, the ""quintessential"" seizure of the person (Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 585; California v. Hodari D., 499 U.S. 621, 624 (1991)). At common law, the application of physical force with intent to restrain constituted an arrest—even if the person did not yield—based on the ""slightest touching"" as constructive detention (e.g., Genner v. Sparks, 6 Mod. 173, 87 Eng. Rep. 928 (QB 1704); 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 288 (1768); cases like Anonymus, 1 Vent. 306, 86 Eng. Rep. 197 (KB 1677); Nicholl v. Darley, 2 Y. & J. 399, 400, 148 Eng. Rep. 974 (Exch. 1828)). This rule applied equally to criminal and civil arrests and extended to force from a distance, such as a bullet, as the Fourth Amendment focuses on individual privacy and security, not the form of intrusion (Camara v. Municipal Court of City and County of San Francisco, 387 U.S. 523, 528 (1967)). A seizure requires force applied with objective intent to restrain, not by accident or other purpose (County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 844 (1998); Michigan v. Chesternut, 486 U.S. 567, 574 (1988)), independent of officer or suspect subjective motivations or perceptions. A seizure by force lasts only as long as the force is applied, absent submission (Hodari D., 499 U.S., at 625). The Court rejected the officers' proposed uniform test of ""intentional acquisition of physical control"" (Brower v. County of Inyo, 489 U.S. 593, 596 (1989)), as it lacks historical or precedential support, conflates seizures by force (requiring mere-touch rule) with those by control or show of authority (requiring submission or termination of movement), and creates line-drawing uncertainties avoided by the common law rule. Applying the rule, the officers seized Torres for the instant the bullets struck her, manifesting objective intent to restrain her movement. The Court did not address the reasonableness of the seizure, damages, or qualified immunity. The judgment of the Tenth Circuit (769 Fed. Appx. 654) was vacated and remanded. Justice Gorsuch filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Thomas and Alito. Justice Barrett took no part.

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
Facts of the case

In March 2018, the City of Philadelphia barred Catholic Social Services (CSS) from placing children in foster homes because of its policy of not licensing same-sex couples to be foster parents. CSS sued the City of Philadelphia, asking the court to order the city to renew their contract. CSS argued that its right to free exercise of religion and free speech entitled it to reject qualified same-sex couples because they were same-sex couples, rather than for any reason related to their qualifications to care for children.

The district court denied CSS's motion for a preliminary injunction, and the Third Circuit affirmed, finding that the City's non-discrimination policy was a neutral, generally applicable law and that CSS had not demonstrated that the City targeted CSS for its religious beliefs or was motivated by ill will against its religion.

Question
1. To succeed on their free exercise claim, must plaintiffs prove that the government would allow the same conduct by someone who held different religious views, or only provide sufficient evidence that a law is not neutral and generally applicable?

2. Should the Court revisit its decision in Employment Division v. Smith?

3. Does the government violate the First Amendment by conditioning a religious agency's ability to participate in the foster care system on taking actions and making statements that directly contradict the agency's religious beliefs?

Conclusion
The refusal of Philadelphia to contract with CSS for the provision of foster care services unless CSS agrees to certify same-sex couples as foster parents violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. Chief Justice John Roberts authored the majority opinion of the Court.

Philadelphia's actions burdened CSS's religious exercise by forcing it either to curtail its mission or to certify same-sex couples as foster parents, in violation of its stated religious beliefs. Although the Court held in Employment Division v. Smith that neutral, generally applicable laws may incidentally burden religion, the Philadelphia law was not neutral and generally applicable because it allowed for exceptions to the anti-discrimination requirement at the sole discretion of the Commissioner. Additionally, CSS's actions do not fall within public accommodations laws because certification as a foster parent is not ""made available to the public"" in the usual sense of the phrase. Thus, the non-discrimination requirement is subject to strict scrutiny, which requires that the government show the law is necessary to achieve a compelling government interest.

The Court pointed out that the question is not whether the City has a compelling interest in enforcing its non-discrimination policies generally, but whether it has such an interest in denying an exception to CSS. The Court concluded that it did not.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote a separate concurring opinion in which Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined and in which Justice Stephen Breyer joined as to all but the first paragraph. Justice Barrett acknowledged strong arguments for overruling Smith but agreed with the majority that the facts of the case did not trigger Smith.

Justice Samuel Alito authored an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch joined. Justice Alito would overrule Smith, replacing it with a rule that any law that burdens religious exercise must be subject to strict scrutiny.

Justice Gorsuch authored an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which Justices Thomas and Alito joined, criticizing the majority's circumvention of Smith.


## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
Here is a summary of the Supreme Court's opinion in *Fulton et al. v. City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, et al.*:

### 1. Facts of the Case

Philadelphia's foster care system operates through a partnership between the City and private foster care agencies. These agencies are responsible for certifying prospective foster families according to state criteria. Catholic Social Services (CSS), an agency that has contracted with the City for over 50 years, holds a religious belief that marriage is exclusively between a man and a woman. Consequently, CSS will not certify unmarried couples or same-sex married couples as foster parents, viewing such certification as an endorsement of their relationships. Other agencies in Philadelphia do certify same-sex couples, and no same-sex couple has ever sought certification from CSS.

In 2018, a newspaper article highlighted the Archdiocese of Philadelphia's position that CSS could not consider same-sex married couples as foster parents. This led to investigations and ultimately the City informing CSS that it would cease referring children to the agency and would not enter future foster care contracts with CSS unless the agency agreed to certify same-sex couples. The City cited violations of a non-discrimination provision in its contract with CSS and the citywide Fair Practices Ordinance. CSS and three affiliated foster parents sued, alleging that the City's actions violated the Free Exercise and Free Speech Clauses of the First Amendment. The District Court denied preliminary relief, finding the City's policies to be neutral and generally applicable under *Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith*, 494 U. S. 872. The Third Circuit affirmed, reaching a similar conclusion regarding the City's proposed contract renewal terms.

### 2. Legal Question(s)

The primary legal question before the Supreme Court was whether the City of Philadelphia's refusal to contract with Catholic Social Services (CSS) for foster care services, unless CSS agreed to certify same-sex couples as foster parents, violated the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. The Court also considered whether the City's actions violated the Free Speech Clause, though it ultimately did not rule on this aspect. A related question involved the applicability and general applicability of the City's Fair Practices Ordinance.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding

The Supreme Court held that the City of Philadelphia's refusal to contract with CSS unless it agreed to certify same-sex couples as foster parents violated the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.

The Court reasoned that the City's actions burdened CSS's religious exercise by forcing it to choose between curtailing its mission or violating its religious beliefs. The Court found that the City's policies were not ""neutral and generally applicable"" as required by *Smith*. Specifically, the Court determined that the non-discrimination requirement in the City's standard foster care contract was not generally applicable because it contained a provision allowing for exceptions at the ""sole discretion"" of the Commissioner. The existence of a mechanism for individualized, discretionary exemptions meant the policy was not generally applicable, and therefore, the City could not refuse to extend such exemptions to cases of religious hardship without a compelling reason.

The Court also concluded that the City's Fair Practices Ordinance did not apply to CSS's actions. The Court reasoned that the process of certifying foster parents is a ""customized and selective assessment"" that does not constitute a ""public accommodation"" as defined by the ordinance, distinguishing it from services like staying in a hotel or eating at a restaurant.

Because the contractual non-discrimination requirement burdened CSS's religious exercise and was not generally applicable, it was subject to strict scrutiny. The Court found that the City did not have a compelling interest in denying an exception to CSS under these circumstances. CSS sought only an accommodation to continue its mission in accordance with its beliefs, not to impose those beliefs on others. Therefore, the City's refusal to contract with CSS could not survive strict scrutiny. The Court reversed the judgment of the Third Circuit and remanded the case.

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
### Summary of Fulton v. City of Philadelphia

#### Facts of the Case
The case involves Catholic Social Services (CSS), a foster care agency in Philadelphia that has been contracted by the City to provide foster care services for over 50 years. CSS holds the religious belief that marriage is between a man and a woman and therefore will not certify same-sex couples as foster parents. In 2018, the City discovered CSS's policy and informed the agency that it would no longer refer children to CSS or enter into a new contract unless CSS agreed to certify same-sex couples. CSS and several affiliated foster parents filed suit, alleging that the City's actions violated the Free Exercise and Free Speech Clauses of the First Amendment.

#### Legal Question(s)
The Court addressed whether the City's actions in conditioning its contract with CSS on the agency's agreement to certify same-sex couples violated the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. Specifically, the Court examined whether the City's non-discrimination policies were neutral and generally applicable, as required by Employment Division v. Smith (1990).

#### Conclusion/Holding
The Court held that the City's refusal to contract with CSS unless it agreed to certify same-sex couples violated the Free Exercise Clause. The Court found that the City's non-discrimination requirement in its contract with CSS was not generally applicable because it included a system of individualized exemptions at the discretion of the Commissioner. The Court also concluded that the City's Fair Practices Ordinance did not apply to CSS's certification practices, as foster care agencies are not considered ""public accommodations"" under the ordinance. The Court applied strict scrutiny to the City's actions and found that they were not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. The judgment of the Third Circuit was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.

The concurring opinions by Justices Barrett, Alito, and Gorsuch addressed the issue of whether to overrule Employment Division v. Smith, with Justices Alito and Gorsuch arguing that it should be overruled due to its flawed reasoning and inconsistency with the original meaning of the Free Exercise Clause.

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
### 1. Facts of the Case
Petitioners Sharonell Fulton et al., including Catholic Social Services (CSS) and three affiliated foster parents, challenged the City of Philadelphia's refusal to refer children to CSS or renew its foster care contract unless CSS agreed to certify same-sex married couples as foster parents. Philadelphia's foster care system relies on contracts with private agencies, including CSS, which has provided services for over 50 years under Pennsylvania statutory criteria (55 Pa. Code §§3700.61, 3700.64, 3700.69). CSS holds the religious belief that marriage is a sacred bond between one man and one woman and thus will not certify unmarried couples (regardless of sexual orientation) or same-sex married couples, viewing certification as an endorsement of relationships; it certifies gay or lesbian individuals as single foster parents and refers same-sex couples to over 20 other agencies that certify them. No same-sex couple has sought certification from CSS. In 2018, following a newspaper story on the Archdiocese of Philadelphia's position, the City Council called for investigation, the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations inquired, and the Department of Human Services Commissioner met with CSS leadership before halting referrals, citing violations of contract non-discrimination provisions (§3.21, allowing exceptions at Commissioner's ""sole discretion,"" and §15.1) and the Fair Practices Ordinance (Phila. Code §9–1106(1), prohibiting discrimination in public accommodations, §9–1102(1)(w)). CSS and foster parents filed suit alleging Free Exercise and Free Speech violations under the First Amendment, seeking to enjoin the referral freeze. The District Court denied preliminary relief, holding the contract and Ordinance neutral and generally applicable under Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872 (1990) (320 F. Supp. 3d 661 (ED Pa. 2018)). The Third Circuit affirmed post-contract expiration, finding proposed renewal terms neutral and generally applicable under Smith (922 F. 3d 140 (CA3 2019)). The Supreme Court granted certiorari (589 U. S. ___ (2020)) to review the Third Circuit's application of Smith and whether to reconsider Smith.

### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Court addressed whether Philadelphia's refusal to contract with CSS for foster care services unless CSS certifies same-sex couples violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, specifically whether the City's contractual non-discrimination requirement (§3.21 and §15.1) and Fair Practices Ordinance are neutral and generally applicable under Smith, 494 U. S. 872 (neutral laws incidentally burdening religion not subject to strict scrutiny), or trigger strict scrutiny per Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520 (1993) (laws not generally applicable if allowing individualized exemptions, Smith, 494 U. S. at 884). Petitioners also challenged Smith's validity.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Court unanimously reversed the Third Circuit (922 F. 3d 140) and remanded (6-3 majority opinion by Roberts, C.J., joined by Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan, Kavanaugh, Barrett, JJ.). Philadelphia's actions violate the Free Exercise Clause. The contractual non-discrimination requirement burdens CSS's religious exercise (forcing curtailment of mission or violation of beliefs) and is not generally applicable due to §3.21's discretionary exceptions at the Commissioner's ""sole discretion,"" inviting individualized assessments and prohibiting refusal of religious hardship exemptions without compelling reason (Smith, 494 U. S. at 884; Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398 (1963)); state law prevents interpreting §15.1 to nullify §3.21's exceptions (Shehadi v. Northeastern Nat. Bank of Pa., 474 Pa. 232 (1977)). Strict scrutiny applies (Lukumi, 508 U. S. at 546): City lacks compelling interest in denying CSS an exception, as CSS seeks only accommodation to serve children consistent with beliefs without imposing them on others, increasing (not reducing) foster parents, posing no liability risk (certification authority state-delegated, 55 Pa. Code §3700.61), and undermining equal treatment claims via exceptions. The Fair Practices Ordinance does not apply, as foster certification is not ""made available to the public"" (Phila. Code §9–1102(1)(w); selective, customized process unlike hotels/restaurants). No need to address Free Speech or overrule Smith. Barrett, J., concurred (joined by Kavanaugh, J.; Breyer, J., except first paragraph), noting strict scrutiny applies regardless of Smith due to discretionary exceptions. Alito, J., concurred in judgment (joined by Thomas, Gorsuch, JJ.), urging Smith overruling. Gorsuch, J., concurred in judgment (joined by Thomas, Alito, JJ.), criticizing avoidance of Smith. Precedent: Reiterates Smith exceptions for non-generally applicable policies (individualized exemptions trigger strict scrutiny); clarifies foster certification not public accommodation.

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
Facts of the case

Nathan Van Buren was a sergeant with the Cumming, Georgia, Police Department. In that capacity, he came to know a man named Andrew Albo, who allegedly paid young prostitutes to spend time with him and then accused the women of stealing the money he gave them. Van Buren asked Albo for a loan, falsely claiming that he needed over $15,000 to settle his son's medical bills. Unbeknownst to Van Buren, Albo recorded the conversation in which Van Buren requested the loan. Albo presented the recording to a detective in the Forsyth County Sheriff's Office, alleging that Van Buren was ""shaking him down for his money."" As a result, the FBI conducted a sting operation to test how far Van Buren was willing to go for money. As part of the sting operation, Albo asked Van Buren to look into a woman Albo named, to see whether she was an undercover officer before he would provide Van Buren with the full amount of money Van Buren requested. Van Buren searched the woman's information in a government database maintained by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) and the FBI. The next day, FBI and GBI agents confronted Van Buren, and Van Buren admitted to the fake story about his son to get the loan from Albo, his use of the government database to search for the woman Albo mentioned might be an undercover officer, and that he understood the purpose of searching the database was to discover and reveal to Albo whether the woman was an undercover officer.

A federal grand jury charged Van Buren with one count of honest-services wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1343 and 1346, and one count of felony computer fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1030. A jury convicted Van Buren on both counts, and Van Buren appealed his convictions. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit found the jury instructions as to the honest-services count were fatally flawed and remanded that charge for a new trial. It found no deficiencies in the conviction for computer fraud and affirmed that conviction, citing Eleventh Circuit precedent holding that a person with authority to access a computer can be guilty of computer fraud if that person subsequently misuses the computer.

Question
Does a person who is authorized to access information on a computer for certain purposes violate Section 1030(a)(2) of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act if he accesses that information for an improper purpose?

Conclusion
An individual ""exceeds authorized access"" under Section 1030(a)(2) of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 when he accesses a computer with authorization and obtains information located in particular areas of the computer that are off-limits to him, not simply when he obtains information available to him with improper motives. Justice Amy Coney Barrett authored the 6-3 majority opinion of the Court.

Under Section 1030(e)(6), an individual ""exceeds authorized access"" when he ""access[es] a computer with authorization"" and ""use[s] such access to obtain . . . information in the computer that the accesser is not entitled so to obtain."" The parties in this case agreed that Van Buren was entitled to obtain the license-plate information, but they disagreed that he was ""entitled so to obtain"" it."" Van Buren argued that the phrase means information one is not allowed to obtain ""by using a computer that he is authorized to access,"" while the government argued that it meant information one was not allowed to obtain ""in the particular manner or circumstances in which he obtained it."" The Court found Van Buren's interpretation more plausible and natural than the government's, and the statute's structure further supports that interpretation. Moreover, the statutory history—Congress's choice to remove the statute's reference to purpose—lends still further support to Van Buren's reading. Finally, to adopt the government's interpretation ""would attach criminal penalties to a breathtaking amount of commonplace computer activity"" and would inject arbitrariness into the assessment of criminal liability.

Justice Clarence Thomas authored a dissenting opinion, which Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito joined, arguing that ""the text, ordinary principles of property law, and statutory history"" support the government's proposed interpretation of the provision.


## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
Here is a summary of the Supreme Court's opinion in *Van Buren v. United States*:

## Summary of *Van Buren v. United States*

### 1. Facts of the Case

Nathan Van Buren, a former police sergeant for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, was charged with a felony violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 (CFAA). The charges stemmed from his actions while on duty, where he used his patrol-car computer and his own valid credentials to access a law enforcement database. Van Buren conducted a search for a specific license plate number in exchange for money, approximately $5,000, from an individual named Andrew Albo. Unbeknownst to Van Buren, his actions were part of a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) sting operation.

Van Buren's conduct violated a department policy that prohibited obtaining database information for non-law-enforcement purposes. The government argued that this violation of departmental policy also constituted a violation of the CFAA. A jury convicted Van Buren, and he was sentenced to 18 months in prison. Van Buren appealed, arguing that the CFAA's ""exceeds authorized access"" clause only applies to individuals who access information to which their computer access does not extend, not to those who misuse access they otherwise possess. The Eleventh Circuit, adhering to its precedent, affirmed the conviction. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve a split among the federal circuit courts regarding the interpretation of this clause.

### 2. Legal Question(s)

The central legal question before the Supreme Court was the interpretation of the phrase ""exceeds authorized access"" as defined in the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 (CFAA). Specifically, the Court addressed:

*   Whether the CFAA's provision making it illegal to ""intentionally accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access"" and thereby obtains information, when read in conjunction with the definition of ""exceeds authorized access"" as ""to access a computer with authorization and to use such access to obtain or alter information in the computer that the accesser is not entitled so to obtain or alter"" (18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(2), (e)(6)), applies to an individual who has authorization to access a computer and its information but uses that access for an improper purpose that violates a departmental policy.
*   More narrowly, what does the phrase ""is not entitled so to obtain"" mean within the definition of ""exceeds authorized access""?

### 3. Conclusion/Holding

The Supreme Court held that an individual ""exceeds authorized access"" under the CFAA when they access a computer with authorization but then obtain information located in particular areas of the computer—such as specific files, folders, or databases—that are off-limits to them. The Court ruled that Van Buren did not violate the CFAA because he had authorization to access the law enforcement database and was entitled to obtain the type of information he retrieved (license plate information). His violation was one of departmental policy regarding the *purpose* for which he obtained the information, not a violation of his *access* to the information itself.

The Court reasoned that the phrase ""entitled so to obtain"" refers to the entitlement to obtain information in the *manner* previously stated in the statute, which is by using a computer one is authorized to access. The word ""so"" acts as a term of reference, pointing back to the authorized manner of access. Therefore, if an individual is authorized to access a computer and the information within it, they do not ""exceed authorized access"" by obtaining that information for an improper purpose. The Court found that the government's interpretation would criminalize a vast amount of commonplace computer activity, such as employees sending personal emails on work computers, which was not the intent of the CFAA. The Court reversed the Eleventh Circuit's judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings.

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
### Summary of Supreme Court Opinion in Van Buren v. United States

#### 1. Facts of the Case
Nathan Van Buren, a former Georgia police sergeant, used his patrol-car computer to access a law enforcement database to retrieve information about a particular license plate number in exchange for money. Although Van Buren had valid credentials to access the database, his actions violated department policy against obtaining database information for non-law-enforcement purposes. The access was part of an FBI sting operation. Van Buren was charged and convicted under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) for ""exceeding authorized access"" by accessing the database for an improper purpose.

#### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Supreme Court addressed the specific legal question of whether Van Buren ""exceeded authorized access"" under the CFAA by accessing a computer with authorization but using that access to obtain information for an improper purpose. The CFAA defines ""exceeds authorized access"" as accessing a computer ""with authorization and to use such access to obtain or alter information in the computer that the accesser is not entitled so to obtain or alter."" The key issue was the interpretation of ""entitled so to obtain,"" particularly the meaning of ""so"" and its implications for determining when someone exceeds authorized access.

#### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Supreme Court held that Van Buren did not ""exceed authorized access"" under the CFAA. The Court interpreted ""exceeds authorized access"" to mean accessing a computer with authorization but then obtaining information located in particular areas of the computer to which the accesser lacks access privileges. The Court ruled that the phrase ""is not entitled so to obtain"" refers to information that a person is not allowed to obtain by using a computer they are authorized to access. The Court's reasoning was based on the plain meaning of the statute, the structure of the CFAA, and the implications of different interpretations on common computer activities. The Court reversed the Eleventh Circuit's judgment and remanded the case.

The Court's decision was based on a detailed analysis of the statutory text, particularly the meaning of ""so"" in the context of ""entitled so to obtain."" The majority rejected the Government's broader interpretation that would have criminalized a wide range of commonplace computer activities, emphasizing that their interpretation aligns with the specialized meaning of ""access"" in the computing context and the statutory structure. The dissent, however, argued that the majority's interpretation contradicts basic principles of property law and the ordinary meaning of ""exceeds authorized access.""

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
Facts of the case

In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) against a constitutional challenge by characterizing the penalty for not buying health insurance as a tax, which Congress has the power to impose. In 2017, the Republican-controlled Congress enacted an amendment to the ACA that set the penalty for not buying health insurance to zero, but it left the rest of the ACA in place. Texas and several other states and individuals filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging the individual mandate again, arguing that because the penalty was zero, it can no longer be characterized as a tax and is therefore unconstitutional. California and several other states joined the lawsuit to defend the individual mandate.

The federal district court held that the individual mandate is now unconstitutional and that as a result, the entire ACA is invalidated because the individual mandate cannot be ""severed"" from the rest of the Act. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the district court's conclusion but remanded the case for reconsideration of whether any part of the ACA survives in the absence of the individual mandate. The Supreme Court granted California's petition for review, as well as Texas's cross-petition for review.

Question
Do the plaintiffs in this case have standing to challenge the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which now has a penalty of zero for not buying health insurance?

If the plaintiffs have standing, is the individual mandate unconstitutional?

If the individual mandate is unconstitutional, is it severable from the remainder of the ACA?

Conclusion
The plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the Affordable Care Act's minimum essential coverage provision. Justice Stephen Breyer authored the 7-2 majority opinion of the Court.

To have standing to bring a claim in federal court, a plaintiff must ""allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief."" No plaintiff in this case has shown such an injury.

With respect to the individual plaintiffs, the Court found the injuries they alleged—past and future payments necessary to carry the minimum essential coverage that §5000A(a) requires—not ""fairly traceable"" to the allegedly unlawful conduct. There is no penalty for noncompliance, only the statute's unenforceable language, which alone is insufficient to establish standing.

With respect to the state plaintiffs, the Court found the injuries they alleged not traceable to the government's allegedly unlawful conduct. The state plaintiffs alleged direct and indirect injuries. The states alleged indirect injuries in the form of increased costs to run state-operated medical insurance programs, but they failed to show how an unenforceable mandate would cause state residents to enroll in valuable benefits programs that they would otherwise forgo. The states alleged direct injuries in the form of increased administrative and related expenses, but those expenses are the result of other provisions of the Act, not §5000A(a) and are thus not fairly traceable to the conduct alleged.

Justice Clarence Thomas authored a concurring opinion, praising Justice Samuel Alito's dissent in this case (describing the ""epic Affordable Care Act trilogy"") but stopping short of agreeing with his opinion in its entirety because Justice Thomas agreed with the majority that the plaintiffs lack standing in this case.

Justice Samuel Alito authored a dissenting opinion, which Justice Neil Gorsuch joined, arguing that Texas and the other state plaintiffs have standing and that because the ""tax"" imposed by the individual mandate is now $0, the mandate cannot be sustained under the taxing power.


## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
Here is a summary of the Supreme Court's opinion in *California v. Texas*:

### 1. Facts of the Case

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), as originally enacted in 2010, required most Americans to obtain minimum essential health insurance coverage and imposed a monetary penalty on those who failed to do so. In 2017, Congress amended the ACA, effectively nullifying this penalty by reducing its amount to $0.

Following this amendment, Texas, joined by 17 other states and two individuals (Neill Hurley and John Nantz), filed a lawsuit against federal officials. The plaintiffs argued that without the penalty, the ACA's minimum essential coverage provision, codified at 26 U.S.C. §5000A(a), was unconstitutional. They sought a declaration that this provision was unconstitutional, a finding that the rest of the ACA was not severable from §5000A(a), and an injunction against the enforcement of the entire Act.

The District Court found that the individual plaintiffs had standing, declared §5000A(a) unconstitutional, and determined it was not severable from the rest of the ACA. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that the plaintiffs had standing and that §5000A(a) was unconstitutional, but it concluded that the District Court's severability analysis was insufficient to strike down the entire Act and remanded the case. California and other states intervened to defend the ACA's constitutionality and sought further review by the Supreme Court.

### 2. Legal Question(s)

The central legal question before the Supreme Court was whether the plaintiffs—the states and the two individuals—had standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the minimum essential coverage provision of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), 26 U.S.C. §5000A(a), after Congress reduced the penalty for non-compliance to zero. Specifically, the Court considered whether the plaintiffs had alleged a concrete and particularized injury in fact that was fairly traceable to the government's conduct in enforcing §5000A(a) and that could be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding

The Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs did not have standing to challenge the ACA's minimum essential coverage provision. The Court reasoned that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate a past or future injury that was fairly traceable to the government's conduct in enforcing the specific statutory provision they attacked as unconstitutional.

The Court explained that for standing, a plaintiff must allege a personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.

*   **For the individual plaintiffs:** The Court found that while they alleged a pocketbook injury (payments for health insurance), this injury was not fairly traceable to any unlawful conduct by the government. Because the penalty for non-compliance with §5000A(a) was zero, the provision was unenforceable. The individuals had not shown any government action or conduct that caused or would cause their alleged injury. The Court emphasized that unenforce able statutory language alone is insufficient to establish standing, and the relief sought (declaratory relief that the provision is unconstitutional) would amount to an advisory opinion without the possibility of an Article III remedy.

*   **For the state plaintiffs:** The Court found that they also failed to show that their alleged pocketbook injuries were traceable to the government's conduct.
    *   Regarding indirect injury (increased costs to state-run insurance programs due to more enrollments), the Court found that the states had not shown how this alleged harm was traceable to the government's enforcement of §5000A(a). Furthermore, they had not shown that the unenforceable provision would lead more individuals to enroll in these programs, as such theories often rely on speculation about independent third-party decisions.
    *   Regarding direct injury (increased administrative expenses), the Court noted that these expenses were imposed by other provisions of the ACA, not §5000A(a) itself, and these other provisions were enforced independently of §5000A(a). Therefore, the government's conduct in enforcing these other provisions was not fairly traceable to the allegedly unlawful provision (§5000A(a)) that the plaintiffs complained of.

The Court declined to consider novel standing theories raised for the first time in the merits briefs.

Consequently, the Supreme Court reversed the Fifth Circuit's judgment regarding standing, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case with instructions to dismiss the complaint for lack of standing.

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
Facts of the case

Nathan Van Buren was a sergeant with the Cumming, Georgia, Police Department. In that capacity, he came to know a man named Andrew Albo, who allegedly paid young prostitutes to spend time with him and then accused the women of stealing the money he gave them. Van Buren asked Albo for a loan, falsely claiming that he needed over $15,000 to settle his son's medical bills. Unbeknownst to Van Buren, Albo recorded the conversation in which Van Buren requested the loan. Albo presented the recording to a detective in the Forsyth County Sheriff's Office, alleging that Van Buren was ""shaking him down for his money."" As a result, the FBI conducted a sting operation to test how far Van Buren was willing to go for money. As part of the sting operation, Albo asked Van Buren to look into a woman Albo named, to see whether she was an undercover officer before he would provide Van Buren with the full amount of money Van Buren requested. Van Buren searched the woman's information in a government database maintained by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) and the FBI. The next day, FBI and GBI agents confronted Van Buren, and Van Buren admitted to the fake story about his son to get the loan from Albo, his use of the government database to search for the woman Albo mentioned might be an undercover officer, and that he understood the purpose of searching the database was to discover and reveal to Albo whether the woman was an undercover officer.

A federal grand jury charged Van Buren with one count of honest-services wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1343 and 1346, and one count of felony computer fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1030. A jury convicted Van Buren on both counts, and Van Buren appealed his convictions. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit found the jury instructions as to the honest-services count were fatally flawed and remanded that charge for a new trial. It found no deficiencies in the conviction for computer fraud and affirmed that conviction, citing Eleventh Circuit precedent holding that a person with authority to access a computer can be guilty of computer fraud if that person subsequently misuses the computer.

Question
Does a person who is authorized to access information on a computer for certain purposes violate Section 1030(a)(2) of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act if he accesses that information for an improper purpose?

Conclusion
An individual ""exceeds authorized access"" under Section 1030(a)(2) of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 when he accesses a computer with authorization and obtains information located in particular areas of the computer that are off-limits to him, not simply when he obtains information available to him with improper motives. Justice Amy Coney Barrett authored the 6-3 majority opinion of the Court.

Under Section 1030(e)(6), an individual ""exceeds authorized access"" when he ""access[es] a computer with authorization"" and ""use[s] such access to obtain . . . information in the computer that the accesser is not entitled so to obtain."" The parties in this case agreed that Van Buren was entitled to obtain the license-plate information, but they disagreed that he was ""entitled so to obtain"" it."" Van Buren argued that the phrase means information one is not allowed to obtain ""by using a computer that he is authorized to access,"" while the government argued that it meant information one was not allowed to obtain ""in the particular manner or circumstances in which he obtained it."" The Court found Van Buren's interpretation more plausible and natural than the government's, and the statute's structure further supports that interpretation. Moreover, the statutory history—Congress's choice to remove the statute's reference to purpose—lends still further support to Van Buren's reading. Finally, to adopt the government's interpretation ""would attach criminal penalties to a breathtaking amount of commonplace computer activity"" and would inject arbitrariness into the assessment of criminal liability.

Justice Clarence Thomas authored a dissenting opinion, which Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito joined, arguing that ""the text, ordinary principles of property law, and statutory history"" support the government's proposed interpretation of the provision.


## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
### 1. Facts of the Case
Nathan Van Buren, a former police sergeant with the Wrens, Georgia Police Department, developed a relationship with Andrew Albo, whom the deputy chief had warned officers to handle carefully as ""very volatile."" Van Buren asked Albo for a personal loan, which Albo secretly recorded and reported to the local sheriff's office as a shakedown. The FBI then conducted a sting operation in which Albo asked Van Buren to use the state law enforcement database—accessible via his patrol-car computer—to run a license plate number purportedly belonging to a woman Albo met at a strip club, to check if she was an undercover officer. Albo offered Van Buren approximately $5,000. Van Buren, using his valid credentials, accessed the database (which contained an FBI-created entry) and retrieved the information, violating department policy trained against ""personal use"" or ""improper purpose"" not connected to law enforcement. Van Buren was charged with a felony violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 (CFAA), 18 U.S.C. §1030(a)(2), for intentionally accessing a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access. A jury convicted him, and the District Court sentenced him to 18 months' imprisonment. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, holding that accessing the database for an ""inappropriate reason"" violated the CFAA consistent with circuit precedent, 940 F. 3d 1192 (2019). The Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve a circuit split on the scope of the ""exceeds authorized access"" clause.

### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Court addressed whether Van Buren violated 18 U.S.C. §1030(a)(2), which criminalizes intentionally accessing a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access to obtain information, where ""exceeds authorized access"" is defined in §1030(e)(6) as ""to access a computer with authorization and to use such access to obtain or alter information in the computer that the accesser is not entitled so to obtain or alter."" Specifically, the Court examined whether this provision applies only to obtaining information from areas of a computer (e.g., files, folders, or databases) to which the user's authorization does not extend (a ""gates-up-or-down"" inquiry), or also to misusing otherwise authorized access for an improper purpose in violation of employer policy.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Court reversed the Eleventh Circuit in a 6-3 decision (opinion by Justice Barrett, joined by Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh; dissent by Justice Thomas, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito) and remanded. Van Buren did not violate the CFAA because he accessed the database with authorization using valid credentials and was entitled to obtain license-plate information from it, notwithstanding his improper purpose. The Court held that ""exceeds authorized access"" under §1030(e)(6) covers only those who obtain information from particular off-limits areas of an authorized computer, not those who misuse access to otherwise available information.

**Reasoning**: (1) Text: The parties agreed Van Buren accessed a protected computer with authorization and obtained information; the dispute turned on ""not entitled so to obtain."" ""So"" is a term of reference to the prior manner stated—obtaining information via an authorized computer—meaning entitlement is assessed based on access rights to the information's location, not purpose (citing Black’s Law Dictionary 1246 (5th ed. 1979)). The Government's broader reading of ""so"" (any circumstance-based limits) lacks textual support and renders ""so"" a hook for external restrictions. ""So"" is not superfluous, as it clarifies digital access entitlement and forecloses non-computer defenses. The dissent's focus on ""entitled"" as circumstance-dependent ignores its modification by ""so to obtain."" Ordinary meaning of ""exceeds authorized access"" yields to the statutory definition, consistent with ""access"" as entry in computing contexts. (2) Structure: §1030(a)(2) distinguishes ""without authorization"" (outside hackers) from ""exceeds authorized access"" (inside hackers entering restricted areas within authorized systems), both via gates-up-or-down inquiries; the Government's purpose-based reading creates inconsistency. Civil remedies under §1030(g) focus on technological ""damage"" or ""loss"" (§§1030(e)(8), (11)), fitting hacking harms, not misuse of accessible data. (3) Precedent and history: Musacchio v. United States, 577 U.S. 237 (2016), did not resolve the issue (dicta only); Congress's 1986 removal of the 1984 Act's explicit ""purpose"" language (§1030(a)(2), 98 Stat. 2191) cuts against purpose-based liability. (4) Implications: The Government's view would criminalize commonplace activity (e.g., personal emails on work computers, terms-of-service violations) and inject arbitrariness based on policy phrasing. The ruling sets precedent narrowing CFAA liability to unauthorized entry or off-limits areas, not improper use.

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
Facts of the case

In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) against a constitutional challenge by characterizing the penalty for not buying health insurance as a tax, which Congress has the power to impose. In 2017, the Republican-controlled Congress enacted an amendment to the ACA that set the penalty for not buying health insurance to zero, but it left the rest of the ACA in place. Texas and several other states and individuals filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging the individual mandate again, arguing that because the penalty was zero, it can no longer be characterized as a tax and is therefore unconstitutional. California and several other states joined the lawsuit to defend the individual mandate.

The federal district court held that the individual mandate is now unconstitutional and that as a result, the entire ACA is invalidated because the individual mandate cannot be ""severed"" from the rest of the Act. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the district court's conclusion but remanded the case for reconsideration of whether any part of the ACA survives in the absence of the individual mandate. The Supreme Court granted California's petition for review, as well as Texas's cross-petition for review.

Question
Do the plaintiffs in this case have standing to challenge the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which now has a penalty of zero for not buying health insurance?

If the plaintiffs have standing, is the individual mandate unconstitutional?

If the individual mandate is unconstitutional, is it severable from the remainder of the ACA?

Conclusion
The plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the Affordable Care Act's minimum essential coverage provision. Justice Stephen Breyer authored the 7-2 majority opinion of the Court.

To have standing to bring a claim in federal court, a plaintiff must ""allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief."" No plaintiff in this case has shown such an injury.

With respect to the individual plaintiffs, the Court found the injuries they alleged—past and future payments necessary to carry the minimum essential coverage that §5000A(a) requires—not ""fairly traceable"" to the allegedly unlawful conduct. There is no penalty for noncompliance, only the statute's unenforceable language, which alone is insufficient to establish standing.

With respect to the state plaintiffs, the Court found the injuries they alleged not traceable to the government's allegedly unlawful conduct. The state plaintiffs alleged direct and indirect injuries. The states alleged indirect injuries in the form of increased costs to run state-operated medical insurance programs, but they failed to show how an unenforceable mandate would cause state residents to enroll in valuable benefits programs that they would otherwise forgo. The states alleged direct injuries in the form of increased administrative and related expenses, but those expenses are the result of other provisions of the Act, not §5000A(a) and are thus not fairly traceable to the conduct alleged.

Justice Clarence Thomas authored a concurring opinion, praising Justice Samuel Alito's dissent in this case (describing the ""epic Affordable Care Act trilogy"") but stopping short of agreeing with his opinion in its entirety because Justice Thomas agreed with the majority that the plaintiffs lack standing in this case.

Justice Samuel Alito authored a dissenting opinion, which Justice Neil Gorsuch joined, arguing that Texas and the other state plaintiffs have standing and that because the ""tax"" imposed by the individual mandate is now $0, the mandate cannot be sustained under the taxing power.


## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
### 1. Facts of the Case

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), enacted in 2010, originally required most Americans to obtain minimum essential health insurance coverage and imposed a monetary penalty on those who failed to comply. In 2017, Congress amended the Act by effectively nullifying the penalty by setting its amount to $0. Texas, along with 17 other states and two individuals (Neill Hurley and John Nantz), brought suit against federal officials, claiming that without the penalty, the ACA's minimum essential coverage provision (26 U.S.C. §5000A(a)) is unconstitutional. They sought a declaration that §5000A(a) is unconstitutional, a finding that the rest of the ACA is not severable from §5000A(a), and an injunction against enforcement of the rest of the ACA. California and other states intervened to defend the ACA's constitutionality.

### 2. Legal Question(s)

The Court addressed the specific constitutional or legal question of whether the plaintiffs have standing to challenge the constitutionality of 26 U.S.C. §5000A(a), the minimum essential coverage provision of the ACA, after the penalty for noncompliance was set to $0 in 2017. The Court considered whether the individual and state plaintiffs have alleged a personal injury fairly traceable to the defendants' allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding

The Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of §5000A(a) because they have not shown a past or future injury fairly traceable to the defendants' conduct enforcing the specific statutory provision they attack as unconstitutional. The Court reasoned that, without a penalty, §5000A(a) is unenforceable, and the individual plaintiffs' alleged pocketbook injury (costs of purchasing health insurance) is not fairly traceable to any Government action or conduct. Similarly, the state plaintiffs' alleged injuries, both indirect (increased costs to state-operated medical insurance programs) and direct (administrative and related expenses), are not traceable to the Government's enforcement of §5000A(a). The Court concluded that the lack of enforcement or threat of enforcement of §5000A(a) means that the plaintiffs' injuries are not redressable by a declaratory judgment that §5000A(a) is unconstitutional. The Court reversed the Fifth Circuit's judgment regarding standing, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case with instructions to dismiss.

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
### 1. Facts of the Case
Texas, along with 17 other states (Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi via its Governor, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia; Wisconsin was dismissed), and two individuals (Neill Hurley and John Nantz), sued the United States, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the IRS, and the Department of Health and Human Services. The suit challenged the minimum essential coverage provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, codified at 26 U.S.C. §5000A(a), claiming it is unconstitutional without the penalty (set to $0 by §11081 of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, Pub. L. 115–97, 131 Stat. 2092), and that the rest of the Act is not severable from §5000A(a). Plaintiffs sought a declaration of unconstitutionality, a finding of nonseverability, and an injunction against enforcement of the Act. California and 15 other states plus the District of Columbia (Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky via its Governor, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington; Colorado, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada joined on appeal) intervened to defend the Act, as did the U.S. House of Representatives on appeal. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Texas v. United States, 340 F. Supp. 3d 579 (2018)) found standing for individual plaintiffs, held §5000A(a) unconstitutional and nonseverable, declared the Act invalid, and stayed judgment (352 F. Supp. 3d 665 (2018)). The Fifth Circuit affirmed standing and unconstitutionality of §5000A(a) but found severability analysis incomplete and remanded (945 F. 3d 355 (2019)). California et al. petitioned for certiorari; Texas et al. conditionally cross-petitioned. The Supreme Court granted certiorari (Nos. 19–840 and 19–1019).

### 2. Legal Question(s)
Whether the plaintiffs have Article III standing to challenge the minimum essential coverage provision at 26 U.S.C. §5000A(a), requiring a showing of personal injury fairly traceable to the defendants' allegedly unlawful conduct in enforcing that provision and likely to be redressed by the requested relief (citing DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U. S. 332, 342 (2006); Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560–561 (1992)). Specific issues included: (1) for individual plaintiffs, whether pocketbook injuries from purchasing insurance are traceable to enforcement of §5000A(a) and redressable by declaratory relief; (2) for state plaintiffs, whether increased costs for state insurance programs (e.g., Medicaid, CHIP, state employee plans under 42 U.S.C. §§1396–1396w, §1397aa) or administrative/reporting expenses (e.g., under §§6055, 6056) are traceable to enforcement of §5000A(a).

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Supreme Court reversed the Fifth Circuit's judgment on standing, vacated it, and remanded with instructions to dismiss, holding that neither individual nor state plaintiffs have Article III standing because they failed to show concrete, particularized injury fairly traceable to the defendants' enforcement of §5000A(a). Justice Breyer delivered the opinion, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Thomas, Sotomayor, Kagan, Kavanaugh, and Barrett. Reasoning: §5000A(a) is unenforceable absent a penalty (now $0 under 26 U.S.C. §5000A(c), (g)), so no government enforcement causes injury (citing Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 751 (1984); Babbitt v. Farm Workers, 442 U. S. 289, 298 (1979)). For individuals, insurance purchase costs are not traceable to enforcement, and declaratory relief alone fails redressability (citing MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U. S. 118, 126–127 (2007)). For states, increased program enrollment is speculative and relies on unpredictable third-party actions without evidence post-2017 (citing Department of Commerce v. New York, 588 U. S. ___ (2019); Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U. S. 398, 410–411 (2013)); administrative costs (e.g., §§6055, 6056) and other obligations (e.g., employer mandate §4980H; dependent coverage §300gg–14; Medicaid expansion) arise from independent, unchallenged provisions. The Court declined novel standing theories not raised below or at certiorari. Justice Thomas concurred, emphasizing plaintiffs' failure to identify unlawful action causing injury. Justice Alito dissented (joined by Justice Gorsuch), arguing states have standing via traceability to enforceable ACA burdens allegedly inseverable from §5000A(a). Precedent reinforces that standing requires injury from actual/threatened enforcement of the challenged provision, not mere unenforceable text, and declaratory relief must satisfy case-or-controversy requirements to avoid advisory opinions (citing Carney v. Adams, 592 U. S. ___ (2020)). The Court did not reach §5000A(a)'s constitutionality or severability.

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
Facts of the case

In NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma, 468 U.S. 85 (1984), the Supreme Court struck down the NCAA's television plan as violating antitrust law, but in so doing it held that the rules regarding eligibility standards for college athletes are subject to a different and less stringent analysis than other types of antitrust cases. Because of this lower standard, the NCAA has long argued that antitrust law permits them to restrict athlete compensation to promote competitive equity and to distinguish college athletics from professional sports.

Several Division 1 football and basketball players filed a lawsuit against the NCAA, arguing that its restrictions on ""non-cash education-related benefits,"" violated antitrust law under the Sherman Act. The district court found for the athletes, holding that the NCAA must allow for certain types of academic benefits, such as ""computers, science equipment, musical instruments and other tangible items not included in the cost of attendance calculation but nonetheless related to the pursuit of academic studies."" However, the district court held that the NCAA may still limit cash or cash-equivalent awards for academic purposes. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, recognizing the NCAA's interest in ""preserving amateurism,"" but concluding nevertheless that its practices violated antitrust law.

Question
Does the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)'s prohibition on compensation for college athletes violate federal antitrust law?

Conclusion
The NCAA's rules restricting certain education-related benefits for student-athletes violate federal antitrust laws. Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Neil Gorsuch upheld the trial court's ruling. The Court affirmed that the traditional ""rule of reason"" standard was appropriate in this case and rejected the NCAA's call for a more deferential standard. Because the student-athletes who brought the lawsuit did not appeal the Ninth Circuit's ruling upholding the NCAA's rules ""untethered to education,"" the Court did not pass judgment on that aspect of the case.

In affirming the Ninth Circuit's ruling, the Court clarified that a prior statement made in the 1984 case NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma noting that the NCAA's role in maintaining the ""revered tradition of amateurism"" was ""entirely consistent with the goals of the Sherman Act"" was not a shield against all challenges to compensation restrictions, as such rules were not even at issue in that case. Instead, there was nothing so unique about the NCAA or amateur sports to alter the traditional method of analysis applied to claims of antitrust violations.

In a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted that while other rules limiting student-athlete compensation unrelated to academics remain in place because they were not properly before the Court, this decision makes clear that the same traditional ""rule of reason"" analysis would apply. He concluded, ""there are serious questions whether the NCAA's remaining compensation rules can pass muster under ordinary rule of reason scrutiny.""


## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
Here is a summary of the Supreme Court's opinion in *National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Alston et al.*:

### 1. Facts of the Case

Current and former student-athletes brought an antitrust lawsuit against the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and its member institutions. They alleged that the NCAA's rules, which restrict the compensation student-athletes can receive for their athletic services, violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act. This section prohibits ""contracts, combinations, or conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce."" Key facts were undisputed: the NCAA and its members agreed to compensation limits for student-athletes, the NCAA enforced these limits, and these limits affected interstate commerce.

The district court, after a bench trial, ruled that certain NCAA rules limiting education-related benefits for student-athletes were unlawful and enjoined them. However, the court upheld NCAA rules that limited undergraduate athletic scholarships and other compensation directly tied to athletic performance. Both the student-athletes and the NCAA appealed. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision in full, finding that it balanced the prevention of anticompetitive harm to student-athletes with the preservation of college sports' popularity. The NCAA petitioned the Supreme Court, seeking to overturn the Ninth Circuit's ruling and have all its compensation restraints upheld. The student-athletes did not renew their broader challenge, so the Supreme Court's review was limited to the subset of NCAA rules that the district court had enjoined. The Court proceeded based on the uncontested premise that the NCAA possesses monopsony control in the relevant market, allowing it to depress student-athlete compensation below competitive levels.

### 2. Legal Question(s)

The primary legal question before the Supreme Court was whether the NCAA's restrictions on education-related benefits for student-athletes violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act. More broadly, the Court considered:

*   Whether the NCAA's compensation restrictions should be subject to ordinary antitrust scrutiny under the ""rule of reason"" analysis.
*   Whether prior Supreme Court precedent, specifically *National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla.*, 468 U. S. 85 (1984), foreclosed antitrust review of the NCAA's compensation rules.
*   Whether the NCAA and its member institutions are exempt from the Sherman Act due to their non-commercial educational objectives.
*   Whether the district court correctly applied the rule of reason analysis in finding certain NCAA restrictions unlawful.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding

The Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision authored by Justice Gorsuch, **affirmed** the judgment of the Ninth Circuit. The Court held that the district court's injunction against certain NCAA rules limiting education-related benefits was consistent with established antitrust principles.

The Court reasoned as follows:

*   **Rule of Reason Analysis:** The Court affirmed that the NCAA's compensation restrictions are subject to the ""rule of reason"" analysis under the Sherman Act. This analysis requires a fact-specific assessment of market power and market structure to determine the restraint's actual effect on competition. The Court rejected the NCAA's arguments that its status as a joint venture or its non-commercial nature warranted a more deferential standard of review. The Court noted that while some joint ventures might warrant abbreviated review, the NCAA, with its admitted monopsony power, did not.
*   **Rejection of *Board of Regents* Precedent:** The Court distinguished *Board of Regents*, stating that the prior case did not expressly approve the NCAA's limits on student-athlete compensation. Instead, *Board of Regents* dealt with television broadcast restrictions and only made passing comments about amateurism, which were not binding precedent on the compensation issue. The Court also emphasized that market realities have changed significantly since 1984, making reliance on older dicta unwise.
*   **No Exemption from Sherman Act:** The Court rejected the NCAA's contention that its non-commercial educational mission exempts it from the Sherman Act. The Court cited precedent, such as *National Soc. of Professional Engineers* and *FTC v. Superior Court Trial Lawyers Assn.*, where similar arguments for special dispensations based on social objectives were rejected. The Court reiterated that the Sherman Act's policy is competition, and any exemptions must come from Congress.
*   **Application of Rule of Reason:** The Court found that the district court correctly applied the rule of reason. The district court properly found that the NCAA possesses monopsony power and that its compensation limits have significant anticompetitive effects. While the NCAA argued that the district court erroneously required it to prove its rules were the ""least restrictive means,"" the Supreme Court clarified that the district court found the NCAA's restraints were ""patently and inexplicably stricter than is necessary"" to achieve proven procompetitive benefits, which is a valid application of the rule of reason. The Court also found that the district court did not impermissibly redefine the NCAA's product but rather assessed the NCAA's asserted justifications for its restraints.
*   **Scope of Injunction:** The Court found that the district court's injunction was appropriately tailored. It only enjoined restrictions on education-related benefits, leaving other compensation rules intact. The Court noted that the injunction provided the NCAA with considerable flexibility to define and regulate education-related benefits and that individual conferences could still impose stricter rules.

In essence, the Court held that the NCAA's restrictions on education-related benefits failed the rule of reason analysis because they imposed undue restraints on trade without sufficient justification, and less restrictive alternatives existed to achieve any proven procompetitive benefits. The Court's decision affirmed that the NCAA is subject to antitrust laws and that its business practices must be evaluated under established legal standards.

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
### Summary of NCAA v. Alston

#### 1. Facts of the Case
The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and its member institutions have rules limiting the compensation that student-athletes can receive. Current and former student-athletes brought an antitrust lawsuit challenging these restrictions under §1 of the Sherman Act. The district court, after a bench trial, found that the NCAA enjoys monopsony power in the market for student-athletes' labor and that its compensation limits produce significant anticompetitive effects. The court enjoined certain NCAA rules limiting education-related benefits but upheld rules limiting undergraduate athletic scholarships and other compensation related to athletic performance. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, and the NCAA appealed to the Supreme Court.

#### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Supreme Court addressed whether the NCAA's compensation restrictions should be subjected to antitrust scrutiny under the ""rule of reason"" analysis and whether the district court's injunction was consistent with established antitrust principles.

#### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Supreme Court held that the district court's injunction is consistent with established antitrust principles. The Court applied the rule of reason analysis, which requires a fact-specific assessment of market power and market structure to assess the challenged restraint's actual effect on competition. The NCAA's compensation restrictions were found to have significant anticompetitive effects, and the district court properly considered the NCAA's procompetitive justifications and the availability of substantially less restrictive alternatives. The Court affirmed the Ninth Circuit's decision, upholding the district court's injunction against the NCAA's rules limiting education-related benefits. The Court's ruling establishes that the NCAA's remaining compensation rules will be subject to ordinary rule of reason scrutiny under the antitrust laws going forward.

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
### 1. Facts of the Case
Current and former student-athletes in men’s Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) football and men’s and women’s Division I basketball, including named plaintiff Shawne Alston, filed a class-action antitrust lawsuit against the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and 11 Division I conferences (collectively, the NCAA), consolidated with American Athletic Conference et al. v. Alston et al., Nos. 20-512 and 20-520. The plaintiffs challenged the NCAA’s rules limiting compensation and benefits for student-athletes as violations of §1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §1. Key undisputed facts included: the NCAA and its members agreed to compensation limits; the NCAA enforced these limits on member schools; and the limits affected interstate commerce and depressed student-athlete compensation below competitive market levels. After years of pretrial proceedings and a 10-day bench trial in In re National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Athletic Grant-in-Aid Cap Antitrust Litig., 375 F. Supp. 3d 1058 (ND Cal. 2019), the district court upheld NCAA rules limiting undergraduate athletic scholarships and compensation unrelated to education but enjoined rules capping education-related benefits, such as graduate or vocational school scholarships, academic tutoring payments, and post-eligibility internships. The injunction took effect in August 2020, applied only to NCAA and multi-conference agreements (leaving individual conferences free to impose restrictions), and allowed the NCAA to define education-related benefits and regulate their provision. Both sides appealed. The Ninth Circuit affirmed in full, holding the district court “struck the right balance,” 958 F. 3d 1239, 1263 (2020). The NCAA petitioned for certiorari, seeking reversal of the injunction; the student-athletes did not challenge the upheld rules. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the enjoined restrictions on the premise of the NCAA’s monopsony power in the market for student-athlete labor in Division I basketball and FBS football.

### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Court addressed whether the NCAA’s restrictions on student-athlete compensation—specifically, the subset limiting education-related benefits—are subject to ordinary rule of reason analysis under the Sherman Act or entitled to more deferential review (e.g., quick-look or abbreviated scrutiny) as a joint venture preserving amateurism; whether National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla., 468 U. S. 85 (1984), approved the NCAA’s compensation limits; whether the NCAA merits a Sherman Act exemption as a noncommercial entity advancing undergraduate education; and whether the district court’s application of the rule of reason—requiring proof of anticompetitive effects, procompetitive justifications, and substantially less restrictive alternatives—and its injunction were lawful, including claims of imposing a least-restrictive-means test, redefining amateurism, and micromanaging the NCAA.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Court unanimously affirmed the Ninth Circuit, holding the district court’s injunction consistent with established antitrust principles. Justice Gorsuch delivered the opinion. The NCAA’s compensation restrictions are subject to ordinary rule of reason analysis—a fact-specific assessment of market power and actual effects on competition—rather than quick-look approval, as the NCAA exercises monopsony power in the labor market for Division I basketball and FBS football student-athletes, suppressing wages and labor quantity below competitive levels. Board of Regents did not analyze or approve compensation limits (focusing instead on television restraints) and its comments on amateurism were non-binding dicta in a changed market. The NCAA receives no antitrust exemption for pursuing noncommercial educational objectives, as the Sherman Act applies regardless and exemptions are for Congress. The district court correctly applied the rule of reason: plaintiffs proved substantial anticompetitive effects (undisputed); the NCAA’s procompetitive justification (preserving consumer demand for amateur college sports distinct from professional sports) succeeded only for non-education-related limits; and plaintiffs showed substantially less restrictive alternatives for education-related benefits, which “emphasize that the recipients are students” without blurring the college-professional distinction or impairing demand. The injunction was narrowly tailored, preserving NCAA leeway to define and regulate education-related benefits, cap academic awards (not below athletic awards of $5,980 annually), police unrelated compensation, and allowing conferences stricter rules; it avoids least-restrictive-means scrutiny or micromanagement. Precedent: NCAA compensation rules receive no special deference and must withstand rule of reason scrutiny; courts must avoid rote frameworks but assess restraints’ effects, justifications, and alternatives cautiously, mindful of judicial limits in dynamic markets. Justice Kavanaugh concurred, noting the decision requires ordinary rule of reason scrutiny for remaining NCAA compensation rules and questioning their procompetitive justification.

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
Facts of the case

Since it was ceded to the United States in 1898, Puerto Rico has accumulated substantial debt, in large part due to its ambiguous legal status as a protectorate of the United States and the economically detrimental policies the United States has enacted over the decades. Exacerbated by a series of governmental financial deficits and a recession, Puerto Rico's debt crisis came to a head in 2015, when its governor announced that the Commonwealth was in a ""death spiral"" and was unable to pay its debt. In June 2016, President Barack Obama signed into law the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act of 2016 (PROMESA), which gave him authority to appoint a seven-member Financial Oversight and Management Board that would have control over Puerto Rico's budget and would negotiate the restructuring of its $125 billion indebtedness. President Obama appointed the seven-member board in August 2016 based on lists supplied by Republic and Democratic lawmakers.

A number of creditors and elected officials of Puerto Rico have been dissatisfied with the board and its decisions and brought a lawsuit challenging President Obama's authority to appoint the board members. The challengers alleged that the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution requires that the Senate confirm high-level federal officers and that the board members were within the scope of this Clause. The federal district court in Puerto Rico ruled against the creditors, finding the board is an instrumentality of the Commonwealth government established pursuant to Congress's plenary powers under the Territorial Clause and that the board members are not ""Officers of the United States.""

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed, concluding that the Territorial Clause does not supersede the application of the Appointments Clause in an unincorporated territory and that the board members are ""Officers of the United States"" because: (1) they occupy ""continuing positions,"" (2) exercise ""significant authority"" that is the same or more than that exercised by other officers the U.S. Supreme Court has found to be ""Officers of the United States,"" and (3) exercise their authority ""pursuant to the laws of the United States."" Moreover, these officers are ""principal"" officers subject to the Appointments Clause because they are answerable to and removable only by the President and are not directed or supervised by others who were appointed by the President with Senate confirmation.

Question
1. Does the Appointments Clause govern the appointment of members of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico?
2. Does the de facto officer doctrine allow courts to deny meaningful relief to successful separation-of-powers challengers who are suffering ongoing injury at the hands of unconstitutionally appointed principal officers?

Conclusion
The Appointments Clause constrains the appointments power as to all officers of the United States, including those who exercise power in or in relation to Puerto Rico, but the Clause does not restrict the appointment or selection of the members of the Financial Oversight and Management Board. Based on this conclusion, the Court had no reason to address the second question presented. Justice Stephen Breyer authored the opinion of the Court that was unanimous in the judgment.

The Appointments Clause of the federal Constitution is intended to allocate between the President and the Senate responsibility for selecting officers to hold high federal positions. Because of this purpose, the Appointments Clause should apply to all officers of the United States, even those with powers and duties related to Puerto Rico.

However, the Appointments Clause does not restrict the appointment of local officers that Congress vests with primarily local duties. When an officer has primarily local duties, he is not an officer of the United States within the meaning of the Appointments Clause. The Board members have primarily local powers and duties, exemplified by the fact that the power of the Board is backed by Puerto Rico law rather than federal law. Indeed, the Board's duty is to oversee the fiscal and budgetary development of Puerto Rico and to initiate bankruptcy proceedings in the interests of Puerto Rico. Consequently, the Appointments Clause does not constrain the appointments power as to the Board members.

Justice Clarence Thomas filed an opinion concurring in the judgment but based on interpretation of the ""original public meaning"" of the phrase ""Officers of the United States"" within the Appointments Clause.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed an opinion concurring in the judgment to explore issues the Court did not (and did not need) to address regarding the relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States.


## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
Here is a summary of the Supreme Court's opinion in *Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico v. Aurelius Investment, LLC*:

### 1. Facts of the Case

In response to a severe fiscal crisis in Puerto Rico, Congress enacted the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) in 2016. PROMESA established a Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico, composed of seven voting members appointed by the President without the advice and consent of the Senate. The Board was granted broad powers, including the authority to file for bankruptcy on behalf of Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities, supervise and modify Puerto Rico's laws and budget, and conduct investigations.

Following the appointment of the Board's members by President Obama, the Board initiated bankruptcy proceedings for Puerto Rico and several of its entities. Several creditors subsequently moved to dismiss these proceedings, arguing that the method of appointing the Board members violated the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The lower court denied these motions, but the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed, holding that the Appointments Clause was violated. However, the First Circuit also concluded that the Board's actions taken prior to its decision were valid under the ""de facto officer"" doctrine. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review these decisions.

### 2. Legal Question(s)

The primary legal question before the Supreme Court was whether the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which requires the President to nominate and the Senate to confirm ""Officers of the United States,"" applies to the appointment of members of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico, given that they are appointed without Senate confirmation.

A related question was whether the Board members, despite their appointment process, were ""Officers of the United States"" within the meaning of the Appointments Clause, or if their duties were primarily local in nature, thereby exempting them from the Clause's requirements.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding

The Supreme Court held that the Appointments Clause applies to the appointment of all ""Officers of the United States,"" including those who exercise power in or in relation to Puerto Rico. However, the Court concluded that the members of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico are **not** ""Officers of the United States"" for the purposes of the Appointments Clause. Therefore, the Appointments Clause does not restrict the method by which they are selected.

The Court reasoned that while the Appointments Clause applies to federal officers, Congress has constitutional authority under Article I, Section 8, Clause 17, and Article IV, Section 3, Clause 2, to create local offices for entities like Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. Historical practice demonstrates that when Congress creates offices with primarily local duties under these provisions, the officers are not considered ""Officers of the United States"" subject to the Appointments Clause.

The Court found that the Board members' powers and duties were primarily local in nature. These included overseeing Puerto Rico's fiscal and budgetary plans, initiating bankruptcy proceedings on behalf of Puerto Rico, and exercising investigatory powers backed by Puerto Rican law. The Court distinguished these duties from those that are ""indisputably federal or national in nature,"" which were the subject of prior Appointments Clause cases like *Buckley v. Valeo*, *Freytag v. Commissioner*, and *Lucia v. SEC*.

Because the Court found the appointment process to be constitutionally valid, it did not need to address the application of the ""de facto officer"" doctrine or consider overruling the ""Insular Cases.""

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
Facts of the case

Since it was ceded to the United States in 1898, Puerto Rico has accumulated substantial debt, in large part due to its ambiguous legal status as a protectorate of the United States and the economically detrimental policies the United States has enacted over the decades. Exacerbated by a series of governmental financial deficits and a recession, Puerto Rico's debt crisis came to a head in 2015, when its governor announced that the Commonwealth was in a ""death spiral"" and was unable to pay its debt. In June 2016, President Barack Obama signed into law the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act of 2016 (PROMESA), which gave him authority to appoint a seven-member Financial Oversight and Management Board that would have control over Puerto Rico's budget and would negotiate the restructuring of its $125 billion indebtedness. President Obama appointed the seven-member board in August 2016 based on lists supplied by Republic and Democratic lawmakers.

A number of creditors and elected officials of Puerto Rico have been dissatisfied with the board and its decisions and brought a lawsuit challenging President Obama's authority to appoint the board members. The challengers alleged that the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution requires that the Senate confirm high-level federal officers and that the board members were within the scope of this Clause. The federal district court in Puerto Rico ruled against the creditors, finding the board is an instrumentality of the Commonwealth government established pursuant to Congress's plenary powers under the Territorial Clause and that the board members are not ""Officers of the United States.""

Moreover, these officers are ""principal"" officers subject to the Appointments Clause because they are answerable to and removable only by the President and are not directed or supervised by others who were appointed by the President with Senate confirmation.

Question
1. Does the Appointments Clause govern the appointment of members of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico?
2. Does the de facto officer doctrine allow courts to deny meaningful relief to successful separation-of-powers challengers who are suffering ongoing injury at the hands of unconstitutionally appointed principal officers?

Conclusion
The Appointments Clause constrains the appointments power as to all officers of the United States, including those who exercise power in or in relation to Puerto Rico, but the Clause does not restrict the appointment or selection of the members of the Financial Oversight and Management Board.

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
### 1. Facts of the Case

The case involves a challenge to the appointment process of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico (the Board), created by Congress under the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) in 2016. The Board was established to oversee Puerto Rico's finances and restructure its debts due to a severe fiscal crisis. The seven voting members of the Board were appointed by President Obama without Senate confirmation. Creditors challenged the appointments, arguing they violated the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which requires Senate confirmation for ""Officers of the United States."" The District Court denied the creditors' motions to dismiss, but the First Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Board members' appointments violated the Appointments Clause. The First Circuit also applied the ""de facto officer"" doctrine to validate actions taken by the Board prior to its decision.

### 2. Legal Question(s)

The primary legal question addressed by the Supreme Court is whether the appointment of the Financial Oversight and Management Board members without Senate confirmation violates the Appointments Clause (Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution). Specifically, the Court must determine if the Board members are ""Officers of the United States"" subject to the Appointments Clause.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding

The Supreme Court held that while the Appointments Clause applies to all ""Officers of the United States,"" including those with powers and duties related to Puerto Rico, the Board members are not ""Officers of the United States"" because they have primarily local powers and duties. The Court reasoned that the Constitution grants Congress the power to create local offices for the District of Columbia and Territories under Article I, Section 8, Clause 17, and Article IV, Section 3, Clause 2. Historically, Congress has used these powers to create local offices with primarily local duties, and officials in such positions are not considered ""Officers of the United States."" The Board's responsibilities, such as representing Puerto Rico in bankruptcy proceedings and overseeing Puerto Rico's fiscal and budgetary policies, are primarily local in nature. Therefore, the Appointments Clause does not dictate how the Board's members must be selected, and their appointment without Senate confirmation is constitutional. The Court reversed the First Circuit's judgment and remanded the cases for further proceedings.

2. Does the de facto officer doctrine allow courts to deny meaningful relief to successful separation-of-powers challengers who are suffering ongoing injury at the hands of unconstitutionally appointed principal officers?

Conclusion
The Appointments Clause constrains the appointments power as to all officers of the United States, including those who exercise power in or in relation to Puerto Rico, but the Clause does not restrict the appointment or selection of the members of the Financial Oversight and Management Board. Based on this conclusion, the Court had no reason to address the second question presented. Justice Stephen Breyer authored the opinion of the Court that was unanimous in the judgment.

The Appointments Clause of the federal Constitution is intended to allocate between the President and the Senate responsibility for selecting officers to hold high federal positions. Because of this purpose, the Appointments Clause should apply to all officers of the United States, even those with powers and duties related to Puerto Rico.

However, the Appointments Clause does not restrict the appointment of local officers that Congress vests with primarily local duties. When an officer has primarily local duties, he is not an officer of the United States within the meaning of the Appointments Clause. The Board members have primarily local powers and duties, exemplified by the fact that the power of the Board is backed by Puerto Rico law rather than federal law. Indeed, the Board's duty is to oversee the fiscal and budgetary development of Puerto Rico and to initiate bankruptcy proceedings in the interests of Puerto Rico. Consequently, the Appointments Clause does not constrain the appointments power as to the Board members.

Justice Clarence Thomas filed an opinion concurring in the judgment but based on interpretation of the ""original public meaning"" of the phrase ""Officers of the United States"" within the Appointments Clause.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed an opinion concurring in the judgment to explore issues the Court did not (and did not need) to address regarding the relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States.


## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
### 1. Facts of the Case
Puerto Rico faced a fiscal crisis, with public debt rising from $39.2 billion in 2005 to $71 billion in 2016, exacerbated by the expiration of tax advantages in 2006, industry exodus, emigration, and inability to restructure debt under federal bankruptcy law or local statutes invalidated in *Puerto Rico v. Franklin Cal. Tax-Free Trust*, 579 U. S. ___ (2016). In response, Congress enacted the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), 130 Stat. 549, 48 U. S. C. §2101 et seq., pursuant to Article IV, §3, cl. 2, creating the Financial Oversight and Management Board (Board) with seven voting members appointed by the President from lists provided by congressional leaders, without Senate confirmation (§101(e), 130 Stat. 554–555). The Governor serves ex officio without vote (§101(b)(e)). On August 31, 2016, President Obama appointed the members, who filed Title III bankruptcy petitions under PROMESA §§301–302, 130 Stat. 577, 579, on behalf of the Commonwealth and five entities: Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation (COFINA), Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority, Employees Retirement System, Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, and Puerto Rico Public Buildings Authority (consolidated in *In re Financial Oversight and Management Bd. of Puerto Rico*, No. 17–BK–3283 (PR)). After proceedings, creditors including Aurelius Investment, LLC, et al., moved to dismiss, arguing the appointments violated the Appointments Clause, Art. II, §2, cl. 2. The District Court denied the motions (*In re Financial Oversight and Management Bd. of Puerto Rico*, 318 F. Supp. 3d 537 (PR 2018)). The First Circuit reversed, holding the appointments unconstitutional but prior actions valid under the de facto officer doctrine (915 F. 3d 838 (2019)). The Board, United States, Aurelius Investment, LLC, et al., Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of All Title III Debtors Other Than COFINA, and Unión de Trabajadores de la Industria Eléctrica y Riego, Inc. petitioned for certiorari (Nos. 18–1334, 18–1475, 18–1496, 18–1514, 18–1521), which the Supreme Court granted and consolidated (588 U. S. ___ (2019)).

### 2. Legal Question(s)
Whether the President's appointment of the seven voting members of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico, without Senate advice and consent as required by the Appointments Clause (Art. II, §2, cl. 2), is constitutional, given PROMESA's creation of the Board pursuant to Congress's Article IV, §3, cl. 2 power and its designation of the Board as ""an entity within the territorial government"" not a federal department, agency, establishment, or instrumentality (§101(c), 130 Stat. 553).

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Supreme Court reversed the First Circuit (915 F. 3d 838) and remanded. Justice Breyer, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Ginsburg, Alito, Kagan, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh, held that the Appointments Clause applies to all ""Officers of the United States,"" including those exercising power in or related to Puerto Rico, based on the Clause's text, structural allocation of appointment power between President and Senate to ensure accountability, historical practice (e.g., Senate confirmation for territorial Governors with federal duties like those under Acts of Aug. 7, 1789, 1 Stat. 50; June 6, 1900, 31 Stat. 325), and absence of Article IV exception. However, the Clause does not restrict appointment of local officers with primarily local duties created under Article I, §8, cl. 17 or Article IV, §3, cl. 2, as confirmed by text distinguishing federal from nonfederal officers, longstanding practice of filling such offices by election or local appointment (e.g., Northwest Territory under Act of Aug. 7, 1789; Puerto Rico under Foraker Act of 1900, 31 Stat. 77; Jones Act of 1917, 39 Stat. 951; Public Law 600, 64 Stat. 319), and precedents like *O’Donoghue v. United States*, 289 U. S. 516 (1933), and *Palmore v. United States*, 411 U. S. 389 (1973). PROMESA Board members exercise primarily local duties: investigatory powers backed by Puerto Rican law (§104, 130 Stat. 558–561); oversight of fiscal plans, budgets, laws, and debt issuance for Puerto Rico (§§201–207, id., at 563–575); representation of Puerto Rico in Title III bankruptcy (§§304, 315, id., at 579, 584); funded by Puerto Rico (§107, id., at 562). Cases like *Buckley v. Valeo*, 424 U. S. 1 (1976); *Freytag v. Commissioner*, 501 U. S. 868 (1991); and *Lucia v. SEC*, 585 U. S. ___ (2018), do not govern, as they involved indisputably federal duties. Justices Thomas and Sotomayor filed opinions concurring in the judgment. Precedent: Appointments Clause requires Senate confirmation for federal officers but not for local officers with primarily local duties in Territories or D.C., even if created by federal law under Article IV or Article I, §8, cl. 17. Court declined to address de facto officer doctrine (*Ryder v. United States*, 515 U. S. 177 (1995)), Insular Cases (e.g., *Downes v. Bidwell*, 182 U. S. 244 (1901)), Federal Relations Act, or Public Law 600.

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
Facts of the case

Petitioners Kendra Espinoza and others are low-income mothers who applied for scholarships to keep their children enrolled in Stillwater Christian School, in Kalispell, Montana. The Montana legislature enacted a tax-credit scholarship program in 2015 to provide a modest tax credit to individuals and businesses who donate to private, nonprofit scholarship organizations. Shortly after the program was enacted, the Montana Department of Revenue promulgated an administrative rule (""Rule 1"") prohibiting scholarship recipients from using their scholarships at religious schools, citing a provision of the state constitution that prohibits ""direct or indirect"" public funding of religiously affiliated educational programs.

Espinoza and the other mothers filed a lawsuit in state court challenging Rule 1. The court determined that the scholarship program was constitutional without Rule 1 and granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the Department of Revenue argued that the program is unconstitutional without Rule 1. The Montana Supreme Court agreed with the Department and reversed the lower court.

Question
Does a state law that allows for funding for education generally while prohibiting funding for religious schools violate the Religion Clauses or the Equal Protection Clause of the federal Constitution?

Conclusion
The application of the Montana Constitution's ""no-aid"" provision to a state program providing tuition assistance to parents who send their children to private schools discriminated against religious schools and the families whose children attend or hope to attend them in violation of the Free Exercise Clause. Chief Justice John Roberts authored the opinion on behalf of the 5-4 majority.

The Court first noted that the Free Exercise Clause ""protects religious observers against unequal treatment"" and against ""laws that impose special disabilities on the basis of religious status."" In this case, Montana's no-aid provision excluded religious schools from public benefits solely because of religious status. As such, the law must be subject to strict scrutiny review; that is, the government must show that its action advances ""'interests of the highest order"" and that the action is ""narrowly tailored in pursuit of those interests."" Montana's interest in this case—which the Court described as creating greater separation of church and state than the federal Constitution requires—does not satisfy strict scrutiny given its infringement of free exercise. Because the Free Exercise Clause barred the application of Montana's no-aid provision, the Montana Supreme Court lacked the authority to invalidate the program on the basis of that provision.

Justice Clarence Thomas authored a concurring opinion in which Justice Neil Gorsuch joined, opining that the Court's interpretation of the Establishment Clause (not at issue in this case) hampers free exercise rights.

Justice Samuel Alito and Justice Gorsuch each filed their own separate concurrences. Justice Alito argued that original motivation should have no bearing on the present constitutionality of a provision of law, yet even without that consideration, the majority reached the correct conclusion in this case. Justice Gorsuch argued that the Court's characterization of the Montana Constitution as discriminating based on ""religious status"" and not ""religious use,"" is dubious at best.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Elena Kagan joined, arguing that the Montana Supreme Court's decision does not place a burden on petitioners' religious exercise and thus does not violate the Free Exercise Clause. The Court's precedents establish that neutral government action is not unconstitutional solely because it fails to benefit religious exercise.

Justice Stephen Breyer filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Elena Kagan joined in part.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed a separate dissenting opinion, arguing that the Court in this case resolved a constitutional question not presented, thereby violating ""Article III principles older than the Religion Clause"" itself.


## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
Here is a summary of the Supreme Court's opinion in *Espinoza et al. v. Montana Department of Revenue et al.*:

### 1. Facts of the Case

The Montana Legislature established a program offering tax credits to individuals who donate to organizations that, in turn, provide scholarships for private school tuition. To comply with a provision in the Montana Constitution (Article X, §6(1)) that prohibits government aid to schools controlled by religious entities, the Montana Department of Revenue enacted ""Rule 1."" This rule specifically prohibited families from using these scholarships at religious schools.

Three mothers whose children attended Stillwater Christian School, a religious institution, were prevented by Rule 1 from using scholarship funds for their children's tuition. They filed a lawsuit in state court, arguing that Rule 1 discriminated against them based on their religious views and the religious nature of their chosen school.

The trial court initially enjoined Rule 1. However, the Montana Supreme Court reversed this decision. The state Supreme Court held that the scholarship program, even without Rule 1, violated the Montana Constitution's no-aid provision by providing aid to religious schools. Consequently, the court invalidated the entire scholarship program. The case reached the U.S. Supreme Court to determine if the application of Montana's no-aid provision violated the Free Exercise Clause of the U.S. Constitution.

### 2. Legal Question(s)

The primary legal question before the Supreme Court was:

*   Does the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibit a state from applying its constitutional no-aid provision to exclude religious schools from a generally available public benefit program (in this case, a tax-credit-funded scholarship program)?

### 3. Conclusion/Holding

The Supreme Court held that the application of Montana's no-aid provision discriminated against religious schools and the families whose children attend them, in violation of the Free Exercise Clause of the U.S. Constitution.

The Court reasoned that the Free Exercise Clause protects individuals from unequal treatment and laws that impose special disabilities based on religious status. Citing *Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer*, the Court stated that disqualifying otherwise eligible recipients from a public benefit ""solely because of their religious character"" triggers strict scrutiny. Montana's no-aid provision, as applied by the Montana Supreme Court, excluded religious schools from the scholarship program solely due to their religious status.

The Court distinguished this case from *Locke v. Davey*, explaining that *Locke* involved a state's decision not to fund a specific ""essentially religious endeavor"" (training for the ministry), whereas Montana's provision barred aid to a religious school ""simply because of what it is""—a religious school. The Court also found no comparable historical tradition supporting Montana's exclusion of religious schools from aid, unlike the tradition against funding clergy that was present in *Locke*.

The Court rejected the Montana Supreme Court's reasoning that the state's interest in greater separation of church and state than required by the Federal Constitution could justify the infringement on free exercise. The Court also found unavailing the argument that the no-aid provision promoted religious freedom, as an infringement of First Amendment rights cannot be justified by a state's alternative view of religious liberty. Furthermore, the Court noted that the provision broadly burdened not only religious schools but also the families who chose them for their children's education.

Finally, the Court concluded that because the Free Exercise Clause barred the application of the no-aid provision, the Montana Supreme Court erred in invalidating the entire scholarship program on that basis. The Court stated that the Montana Supreme Court should have disregarded the no-aid provision and decided the case in accordance with the Federal Constitution.

The judgment of the Montana Supreme Court was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court's opinion. The precedent set is that states cannot exclude religious schools from generally available public benefit programs solely because of their religious status, as this violates the Free Exercise Clause.

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
### Summary of the Supreme Court Opinion in Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue

#### 1. Facts of the Case
The Montana Legislature established a scholarship program in 2015 to provide tuition assistance to parents sending their children to private schools. The program granted tax credits to donors who contributed to student scholarship organizations, which in turn awarded scholarships to selected students. The Montana Department of Revenue promulgated ""Rule 1,"" which prohibited families from using the scholarships at religious schools, citing the Montana Constitution's no-aid provision (Article X, §6(1)). Three mothers, whose children attended a Christian private school, sued the Department, alleging that Rule 1 discriminated against their religious views and the school they chose. The trial court enjoined Rule 1, but the Montana Supreme Court reversed, holding that the program, without Rule 1, aided religious schools in violation of the no-aid provision and invalidated the entire program.

#### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Court addressed whether the application of Montana's no-aid provision, as interpreted by the Montana Supreme Court, discriminated against religious schools and the families whose children attend or hope to attend them, in violation of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.

#### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Supreme Court held that the application of Montana's no-aid provision discriminated against religious schools and the families whose children attend or hope to attend them, in violation of the Free Exercise Clause. The Court applied strict scrutiny because the no-aid provision excluded religious schools from public benefits solely because of their religious status. The Court found that the provision imposed a penalty on the free exercise of religion and that the State's interest in greater separation of church and State than required by the Federal Constitution was not compelling. The Court also rejected the argument that Locke v. Davey governed this case, as Locke involved a denial of a scholarship due to the specific religious use of the funds (training for the ministry), whereas Montana's no-aid provision barred aid to religious schools simply because of their religious status. The Court reversed the Montana Supreme Court's judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings, holding that the Free Exercise Clause barred the application of the no-aid provision and that the Montana Supreme Court had no authority to invalidate the program on that basis.

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
### 1. Facts of the Case
Petitioners Kendra Espinoza and two other mothers sued the Montana Department of Revenue in Montana state court after being blocked by Department ""Rule 1"" (Mont. Admin. Rule §42.4.802(1)(a) (2015)) from using scholarships from the Big Sky Scholarship organization for their children's tuition at Stillwater Christian School, a private Christian school meeting statutory criteria for qualified education providers under Mont. Code Ann. §15–30–3102(7). The scholarship program, enacted by the Montana Legislature in 2015 (2015 Mont. Laws p. 2168; Mont. Code Ann. §§15–30–3101 et seq.), provided tax credits of up to $150 to donors supporting organizations awarding scholarships for private school tuition, with $3 million allotted annually and automatic 10% increases if exhausted, set to expire in 2023. Big Sky Scholarships, the sole participating organization, focused on families facing financial hardship or with children with disabilities, awarding scholarships of $500 each (44 in 2017, 54 in 2018). The program was to be administered consistent with Montana Constitution Art. X, §6(1), barring aid to schools ""controlled in whole or in part by any church, sect, or denomination."" Rule 1 excluded religious schools to comply with this no-aid provision, despite objections from the Montana Attorney General. The trial court enjoined Rule 1, finding it unauthorized as the no-aid provision bars only appropriations, not tax credits. The Montana Supreme Court reversed (393 Mont. 446, 435 P.3d 603 (2018)), holding the unmodified program violated the no-aid provision by subsidizing tuition at religiously affiliated schools and lacked mechanisms to prevent aid to religious schools, invalidating the entire program. The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari (588 U.S. ___ (2019)).

### 2. Legal Question(s)
Whether the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment (applicable to the States via the Fourteenth Amendment) barred the Montana Supreme Court's application of Montana Constitution Art. X, §6(1) to invalidate a tax-credit scholarship program that would otherwise permit religious schools to receive indirect aid through parental choice, thereby excluding religious schools and families solely on the basis of the schools' religious status.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Court reversed the Montana Supreme Court (5-4, opinion by Chief Justice Roberts, joined by Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh, JJ.; concurrences by Thomas (joined by Gorsuch, J.), Alito, J., and Gorsuch, J.; dissents by Ginsburg (joined by Kagan, J.), Breyer (joined by Kagan, J. as to Part I), and Sotomayor, JJ.) and remanded. The application of Montana's no-aid provision violated the Free Exercise Clause by disqualifying otherwise eligible religious schools from public benefits solely because of their religious status, imposing a penalty on free exercise that triggers strict scrutiny (Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer, 582 U.S. ___ (2017)). The provision expressly bars aid to schools ""controlled in whole or in part by any church, sect, or denomination"" (Mont. Const., Art. X, §6(1)), discriminating based on status rather than religious use of funds. Distinguished Locke v. Davey, 540 U.S. 712 (2004), where denial targeted an ""essentially religious endeavor"" (devotional theology degrees) supported by a ""historic and substantial"" tradition against funding clergy; no comparable tradition bars aid to religious schools, and early governments often supported them. Rejected flexible case-by-case analysis as inconsistent with Trinity Lutheran. Montana's interests—greater church-state separation, promoting religious freedom, or protecting public education—failed strict scrutiny (Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 546 (1993)), as they were not compelling and the provision was underinclusive (barring only religious private schools). The Montana Supreme Court erred by applying the no-aid provision despite the Free Exercise violation; under the Supremacy Clause (Art. VI, cl. 2), it had no basis to invalidate the program and was obligated to disregard the provision (Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 178 (1803)). Precedent: A State deciding to subsidize private education cannot disqualify religious schools solely because of their religious character; such status-based discrimination triggers strict scrutiny under the Free Exercise Clause.

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
Facts of the case

In Bladensburg, Maryland, as part of a memorial park honoring veterans is a 40-foot tall cross, which is the subject of this litigation. Construction on the cross began in 1918, and it was widely described using Christian terms and celebrated in Christian services. In 1961, Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission acquired the cross and the land, as well as the responsibility to maintain, repair, and otherwise care for the cross. The Commission has spent approximately $117,000 to maintain and repair the cross, and in 2008, it set aside an additional $100,000 for renovations.

Several non-Christian residents of Prince George's County, Maryland, expressed offense at the cross, which allegedly amounts to governmental affiliation with Christianity. American Humanist Association is a nonprofit organization advocating for separation of church and state. Together, AHA and the individual residents sued the Commission under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that the Commission's display and maintenance of the cross violates the Establishment Clause. Applying the test established in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971), the district court found that the Commission did not violate the Establishment Clause because (1) the cross has a secular purpose, (2) it neither advances nor inhibits religion, and (3) it does not have a primary effect of endorsing religion. The Fourth Circuit reversed and remanded.

Question
1. Is the display and maintenance of the cross unconstitutional?
2. Under what test should the constitutionality of a passive display incorporating religious symbolism be assessed?
3. Does the expenditure of funds to maintain the cross amount to the government's excessive entanglement with religion?

Conclusion
The Bladensburg Cross does not violate the Establishment Clause.

Justice Samuel Alito authored the opinion of the Court, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Stephen Breyer and Brett Kavanaugh. Justice Elena Kagan joined the majority opinion in part.

The Court explained that although the cross originated as a Christian symbol, it has also taken on a secular meaning. In particular, the cross became a symbol of World War I as evidenced by its use in the present controversy. The Lemon test, which the Court first articulated in 1971 as a way to discern Establishment Clause violations, does not serve its intended purpose, particularly as applied to religious symbols or monuments. Thus, when the question arises whether to keep a religious monument in place (as opposed to a question whether to put up a new one), there should be a presumption that the monument is constitutional.

Applying this presumption rather than the Lemon test, the Court found the Bladensburg Cross does not violate the Establishment Clause because it has historical importance beyond its admittedly Christian symbolism.

Justice Breyer joined Justice Alito's opinion in full but wrote a separate concurrence joined by Justice Kagan to highlight his belief that there is no single test for Establishment Clause violations. Rather, a court asked to resolve such questions must consider ""the basic purposes that the Religion Clauses were meant to serve: assuring religious liberty and tolerance for all, avoiding religiously based social conflict, and maintaining that separation of church and state that allows each to flourish in its separate sphere.""

Justice Kavanaugh also joined Justice Alito's opinion in full and also wrote his own concurring opinion. He even more harshly criticized the Lemon test, arguing that ""the Court's decisions over the span of several decades demonstrate that the Lemon test is not good law and does not apply to Establishment Clause cases in any of"" five categories, which he enumerated.

Justice Kagan joined most of Justice Alito's opinion but wrote a separate concurrence to note that, although ""rigid application of the Lemon test does not solve every Establishment Clause problem,"" courts should still focus on the purpose and effect of government action in deciding whether it violates the Constitution.

Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate opinion concurring in the judgment, but based on entirely different reasoning. Justice Thomas does not believe the Establishment Clause applies to state and local governments, and even if it did, it applies only to prevent coercive action by the government. Justice Thomas would overrule the Lemon test in all contexts.

Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote a separate opinion concurring in the judgment, in which Justice Thomas joined. Justice Gorsuch would dismiss the lawsuit for lack of standing, arguing that simply being offended by the cross's presence is insufficient to meet the injury requirement of Article III standing.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Sonia Sotomayor joined. Justice Ginsburg argued that the cross ""is the foremost symbol of the Christian faith,"" and using it as a war memorial doesn't change that. Maryland's decision to maintain that Christian symbol on public land ""elevates Christianity over other faiths, and religion over nonreligion."" Justice Ginsburg additionally pointed out that an appropriate remedy for an Establishment Clause violation is not necessarily to destroy the memorial, as the majority suggests, but to transfer title to the land on which it sits to a private entity—in fact, a private entity owned the land when the cross was first erected.


## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
Here is a summary of the Supreme Court's opinion in *American Legion et al. v. American Humanist Assn. et al.*:

### 1. Facts of the Case

In 1918, a committee formed in Prince George's County, Maryland, to erect a memorial for soldiers who died in World War I. They decided on a Latin cross, a symbol that had become prominent due to its use in marking soldiers' graves overseas. When the committee ran out of funds, the local American Legion took over and completed the 32-foot tall cross monument in 1925. The monument, known as the Bladensburg Cross, features the American Legion's emblem and a plaque listing the names of 49 fallen county soldiers. It has since been the site of patriotic ceremonies. In 1961, the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (Commission) acquired the Cross and the land it stands on, using public funds for its maintenance, while the American Legion retained the right to use the site for ceremonies.

In 2014, the American Humanist Association (AHA) and others filed a lawsuit, arguing that the Cross's presence on public land and the Commission's maintenance of it violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The American Legion intervened to defend the monument. The District Court ruled in favor of the Commission and the American Legion, finding the Cross constitutional under both the *Lemon v. Kurtzman* test and the approach used in *Van Orden v. Perry*. However, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this decision.

### 2. Legal Question(s)

The central legal question before the Supreme Court was:

*   Does the Bladensburg Peace Cross, a 32-foot tall Latin cross monument on public land maintained by a government commission, violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which prohibits government establishment of religion?

### 3. Conclusion/Holding

The Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the Fourth Circuit, holding that the Bladensburg Cross does not violate the Establishment Clause.

The Court, in an opinion authored by Justice Alito, reasoned that retaining established, religiously expressive monuments, symbols, or practices differs from erecting new ones. The Court identified four key considerations:

1.  **Difficulty in Ascertaining Original Purpose:** For long-standing monuments, identifying the precise original intent of the creators can be difficult due to the passage of time and unavailability of testimony.
2.  **Multiplication of Purposes:** Over time, the purposes associated with a monument can multiply. Even if originally religiously motivated, a monument may be retained for its historical significance or its place in common cultural heritage.
3.  **Evolution of Message:** The message conveyed by a symbol can evolve. The cross, while inherently Christian, had taken on a secular meaning as a symbol of sacrifice in World War I, a meaning reinforced by its use in military honors and its presence in war cemeteries.
4.  **Loss of Neutrality Upon Removal:** When a religiously expressive monument gains historical significance and familiarity through time, its removal may be perceived not as a neutral act but as hostility toward religion.

Applying these principles to the Bladensburg Cross, the Court found that its design should be understood in the historical context of World War I, where the plain Latin cross became a symbol of soldiers' sacrifice. The Court noted that the monument had acquired historical importance, serving as a reminder of the community's predecessors and their sacrifices. It also highlighted that the monument had become part of the community's landscape and was used for patriotic events. The Court found no evidence of discriminatory intent in its creation or maintenance. Furthermore, the Court emphasized that removing or altering the monument after nearly a century would not be viewed as a neutral act by many in the community.

The Court also addressed the *Lemon* test, noting that it has been inconsistently applied and has not provided a clear framework for Establishment Clause cases, particularly those involving historical monuments and symbols. Instead, the Court favored a more modest approach guided by history and tradition, referencing precedents like *Marsh v. Chambers* and *Town of Greece v. Galloway*.

In essence, the Court concluded that the Bladensburg Cross, due to its historical context, its evolution into a symbol of sacrifice, its integration into the community, and the passage of time, had acquired a presumption of constitutionality and did not violate the Establishment Clause. The Court reversed the Fourth Circuit's judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings.

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
Facts of the case

In Bladensburg, Maryland, as part of a memorial park honoring veterans is a 40-foot tall cross, which is the subject of this litigation. Construction on the cross began in 1918, and it was widely described using Christian terms and celebrated in Christian services. In 1961, Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission acquired the cross and the land, as well as the responsibility to maintain, repair, and otherwise care for the cross. The Commission has spent approximately $117,000 to maintain and repair the cross, and in 2008, it set aside an additional $100,000 for renovations.

Several non-Christian residents of Prince George's County, Maryland, expressed offense at the cross, which allegedly amounts to governmental affiliation with Christianity. American Humanist Association is a nonprofit organization advocating for separation of church and state. Together, AHA and the individual residents sued the Commission under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that the Commission's display and maintenance of the cross violates the Establishment Clause. Applying the test established in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971), the district court found that the Commission did not violate the Establishment Clause because (1) the cross has a secular purpose, (2) it neither advances nor inhibits religion, and (3) it does not have a primary effect of endorsing religion. The Fourth Circuit reversed and remanded.

Question
1. Is the display and maintenance of the cross unconstitutional?
2. Under what test should the constitutionality of a passive display incorporating religious symbolism be assessed?
3. Does the expenditure of funds to maintain the cross amount to the government's excessive entanglement with religion?

Conclusion
The Bladensburg Cross does not violate the Establishment Clause.

Justice Samuel Alito authored the opinion of the Court, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Stephen Breyer and Brett Kavanaugh. Justice Elena Kagan joined the majority opinion in part.

The Court explained that although the cross originated as a Christian symbol, it has also taken on a secular meaning. In particular, the cross became a symbol of World War I as evidenced by its use in the present controversy. The Lemon test, which the Court first articulated in 1971 as a way to discern Establishment Clause violations, does not serve its intended purpose, particularly as applied to religious symbols or monuments. Thus, when the question arises whether to keep a religious monument in place (as opposed to a question whether to put up a new one), there should be a presumption that the monument is constitutional.

Applying this presumption rather than the Lemon test, the Court found the Bladensburg Cross does not violate the Establishment Clause because it has historical importance beyond its admittedly Christian symbolism.

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
### Summary of the Supreme Court Opinion in American Legion v. American Humanist Association

#### 1. **Facts of the Case**
The case involves a challenge to the constitutionality of a 32-foot tall Latin cross, known as the Bladensburg Peace Cross, erected in 1925 in Prince George's County, Maryland, to honor local soldiers who died in World War I. The cross is owned and maintained by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, a state agency. The American Humanist Association (AHA) and others filed a lawsuit alleging that the cross's presence on public land and the Commission's maintenance of it violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The District Court ruled in favor of the Commission and the American Legion, which intervened to defend the cross, but the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, finding the cross unconstitutional.

#### 2. **Legal Question(s)**
The Supreme Court addressed whether the Bladensburg Peace Cross's presence on public land and the Commission's maintenance of it violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The Court considered whether the cross's historical significance and its role in commemorating World War I veterans rendered it constitutional despite its religious symbolism.

#### 3. **Conclusion/Holding**
The Supreme Court reversed the Fourth Circuit's decision, holding that the Bladensburg Peace Cross does not violate the Establishment Clause. The Court's reasoning, led by Justice Alito, emphasized that the cross has taken on a secular meaning in the context of World War I memorials and has become a part of the community's landscape and identity. The Court applied a more modest approach, looking to history for guidance, and concluded that the cross's longstanding presence and its commemoration of veterans give rise to a strong presumption of constitutionality. The decision underscores the importance of historical context and the evolution of symbols over time in Establishment Clause jurisprudence. The Court's ruling allows the State to maintain the cross on public land but does not require it to do so, leaving open the possibility for alternative solutions, such as legislative or executive action to relocate or transfer ownership of the monument.

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
### 1. Facts of the Case
In 1918, residents of Prince George’s County, Maryland, formed a committee to erect a memorial honoring the county’s soldiers who died in World War I. The committee selected a plain Latin cross as the design, a symbol associated with the war due to images of white crosses marking soldiers’ graves overseas. Funded by private donations, the 32-foot-tall concrete Latin cross was completed in 1925 by the local American Legion post after the committee exhausted funds. The cross sits on a pedestal displaying the American Legion emblem, the words “Valor,” “Endurance,” “Courage,” and “Devotion,” and a bronze plaque listing the names of 49 county soldiers who died in the war, along with dates of U.S. involvement and a quote from President Woodrow Wilson. The dedication ceremony included an invocation by a Catholic priest and a benediction by a Baptist pastor. The cross has since been the site of patriotic events on Veterans Day, Memorial Day, and Independence Day, and is now in Veterans Memorial Park amid monuments to veterans of other wars. As the surrounding area developed into a busy intersection, the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (Commission) acquired the cross and surrounding land in 1961 to preserve the monument and address traffic safety, reserving the American Legion’s right to use the site for ceremonies. The Commission has since spent public funds, including approximately $117,000 over five decades and a budgeted $100,000 in 2008, to maintain it.

In 2014, the American Humanist Association (AHA) and three individuals filed suit against the Commission in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, alleging that the cross’s presence on public land and the Commission’s maintenance violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The American Legion intervened as a defendant. The District Court granted summary judgment for the Commission and American Legion, finding the cross satisfied the Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971), test and Justice Breyer’s analysis in Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U.S. 677 (2005). The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed, 874 F. 3d 195 (2017), holding the cross failed Lemon’s “effects” prong as a reasonable observer would perceive endorsement of Christianity and created excessive entanglement. The Fourth Circuit denied rehearing en banc. The American Legion and Commission petitioned for certiorari, which the Supreme Court granted and consolidated, 586 U.S. ___ (2018).

### 2. Legal Question(s)
Does the government’s ownership and maintenance of the Bladensburg Cross—a 32-foot-tall Latin cross on public land commemorating World War I soldiers—violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment?

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Supreme Court reversed the Fourth Circuit’s judgment and remanded in a judgment announced by Justice Alito, with Parts I, II-B, II-C, III, and IV of his opinion joined by Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Breyer, Justice Kagan, and Justice Kavanaugh, and Parts II-A and II-D joined by Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Breyer, and Justice Kavanaugh (effectively 5-4 on key parts). The Court held the Bladensburg Cross does not violate the Establishment Clause.

Justice Alito’s plurality opinion concluded that longstanding religious monuments, symbols, and practices warrant a strong presumption of constitutionality due to four considerations distinguishing them from new ones: (1) difficulty ascertaining original purposes due to age (citing Salazar v. Buono, 559 U.S. 700 (2010)); (2) multiplication and evolution of purposes over time, potentially obscuring religious origins in favor of historical or cultural significance (citing Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U.S. 677; McCreary County v. American Civil Liberties Union of Ky., 545 U.S. 844 (2005); Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U.S. 460 (2009)); (3) transformation of meaning through familiarity (e.g., city names like Bethlehem, Pennsylvania; Arizona’s motto “Ditat Deus”; Maryland’s flag); and (4) non-neutral appearance of removal, evoking hostility to religion. Applied here, the cross’s association with World War I—via grave markers, Distinguished Service Cross (1918), Navy Cross (1919), and poetry like John McCrae’s “In Flanders Fields”—gave it secular meaning as a symbol of sacrifice, reinforced by its age (94 years), integration into the community amid other veterans’ memorials, lack of discriminatory intent (names of Black and White soldiers included; Jewish veteran involved; ecumenical dedication amid 1920s Klan activity), and role commemorating specific deaths akin to faith symbols in other memorials (e.g., Martin Luther King, Jr. memorials; Holocaust memorials with Stars of David). Parts II-A and II-D critiqued Lemon v. Kurtzman’s purpose/effects/entanglement test as unworkable and abandoned in cases like Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills Sch. Dist., 509 U.S. 1 (1993); Town of Greece v. Galloway, 572 U.S. 565 (2014); instead favoring a history-and-tradition approach exemplified by Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.S. 783 (1983) (legislative prayer).

Justice Breyer concurred (joined by Justice Kagan), agreeing no single formula resolves Establishment Clause cases and upholding based on context: cross’s WWI association, secular motives, lack of exclusion, placement among secular memorials, 94-year history without controversy. Justice Kavanaugh concurred, applying history-and-tradition test, rejecting Lemon across categories, and outlining principles (non-coercive, rooted in history/tradition, equal treatment, or accommodations). Justice Thomas concurred in the judgment, arguing the Clause is not incorporated against states (citing Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1 (1947)); no coercion (historical establishments involved orthodoxy/financial penalties); religious displays need not be nonsectarian (citing Town of Greece); and overruling Lemon entirely. Justice Gorsuch concurred in the judgment (joined by Justice Thomas), urging dismissal for lack of standing as “offended observer” theory lacks basis (citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555 (1992); Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, 454 U.S. 464 (1982)); tied to Lemon, now shelved.

Justices Ginsburg (joined by Justice Sotomayor) dissented, arguing the cross endorses Christianity (citing County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U.S. 573 (1989)), unmitigated by context, history, or war memorial purpose.

The decision sets precedent favoring history, tradition, and context over Lemon for longstanding religious monuments/symbols/practices, presuming their constitutionality absent coercion or discrimination, while preserving case-by-case analysis.

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
Facts of the case

While on patrol, a Kansas police officer ran a registration check on a pickup truck with a Kansas license plate. Upon running the check, the officer learned that the truck was registered to Charles Glover, Jr., and that his license had been revoked. Acting on suspicion that the owner was unlawfully operating the vehicle (based on the assumption that the registered owner of the truck was also the driver), the officer stopped the truck. The officer confirmed that Glover was the driver and issued him a citation for being a habitual violator of Kansas traffic laws.

Glover moved to suppress all evidence from the stop, arguing that the stop violated his Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures. According to Glover, the police officer lacked reasonable suspicion to pull him over. The state argued that a law enforcement officer may infer that the owner of a vehicle is the one driving the vehicle, absent information to the contrary, and the knowledge that the owner has a revoked license combined with that inference gives rise to reasonable suspicion to conduct an investigative stop.

The state trial court concluded that it is not reasonable for an officer to infer that the registered owner of a vehicle is also its driver and granted Glover's motion to suppress. The appellate court reversed, and the Kansas Supreme Court granted review. The supreme court reversed the lower court, holding that the inference impermissibly ""stacked"" assumptions and would relieve the state of its burden of showing reasonable suspicion for a stop.

Question
For purposes of an investigative stop under the Fourth Amendment, is it reasonable for an officer to suspect that the registered owner of a vehicle is the one driving the vehicle absent any information to the contrary?

Conclusion
When a police officer lacks information to the contrary, it is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment for the officer to assume that the driver of a vehicle is its owner, and if the owner's license is revoked, to conduct an investigative stop of the vehicle. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the opinion for the 8-1 majority. Under the Fourth Amendment, a police officer may make a ""brief investigative traffic stop"" when he has ""a particularized and objective basis"" to suspect legal wrongdoing. Courts must permit officers to use common sense to make judgments and inferences about human behavior. In this case, the police officer's common-sense inference was that the vehicle's owner was most likely the driver, which provided sufficient suspicion to stop the vehicle. It does not matter that a vehicle's driver is not always its registered owner; the officer's judgment was based on common-sense judgment and experience. Thus he had reasonable suspicion, and the traffic stop did not violate the Fourth Amendment.

Justice Elena Kagan authored a concurring opinion, in which Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined, to point out that the license-revocation alert does not end the inquiry because, in a similar setting with slightly different facts, there might not be reasonable suspicion. Justice Kagan specifically described that most license suspensions (as opposed to revocations) do not relate to driving at all but are highly correlated with poverty.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor authored a dissenting opinion, arguing that the Court's decision ignores ""key foundations of our reasonable-suspicion jurisprudence and impermissibly and unnecessarily reduces the State's burden of proof."" Justice Sotomayor disagreed with the majority's conclusion that seizing the vehicle was constitutional because drivers with revoked licenses in Kansas have demonstrated a disregard for the law, arguing that that conclusion ""flips the burden of proof.""


## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
Here is a summary of the Supreme Court's opinion in *Kansas v. Glover*:

### 1. Facts of the Case

On April 28, 2016, Deputy Mark Mehrer of the Douglas County, Kansas Sheriff's Office was on routine patrol when he observed a 1995 Chevrolet 1500 pickup truck with Kansas license plate 295ATJ. Deputy Mehrer ran a check on the license plate through the Kansas Department of Revenue's file service. The check revealed that the truck was registered to Charles Glover Jr. and that Mr. Glover's driver's license had been revoked in Kansas. Deputy Mehrer assumed that the registered owner, Charles Glover Jr., was the driver of the truck. He did not observe any traffic infractions and did not attempt to identify the driver. Based solely on the information that the registered owner had a revoked license, Deputy Mehrer initiated a traffic stop. The driver of the truck was indeed Charles Glover Jr., who was subsequently charged with driving as a habitual violator. Glover moved to suppress all evidence from the stop, arguing that Deputy Mehrer lacked reasonable suspicion. The District Court granted the motion. The Kansas Court of Appeals reversed, finding the deputy's inference reasonable. However, the Kansas Supreme Court reversed again, holding that the stop violated the Fourth Amendment because the deputy lacked reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Kansas petitioned for a writ of certiorari, which the Supreme Court granted.

### 2. Legal Question(s)

The central legal question before the Supreme Court was: Whether an investigative traffic stop initiated by a police officer, after running a vehicle's license plate and learning that the registered owner's driver's license has been revoked, is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment when the officer lacks information negating the inference that the owner is the driver.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding

The Supreme Court held that when an officer lacks information that negates the inference that the registered owner of a vehicle is the driver, an investigative traffic stop made after learning that the registered owner's driver's license has been revoked is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.

The Court reasoned that an officer may initiate a brief investigative traffic stop if they have a ""particularized and objective basis"" to suspect legal wrongdoing. This standard requires less suspicion than probable cause and relies on the ""factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act."" The Court found that Deputy Mehrer's commonsense inference that the owner of the truck was likely the driver provided more than reasonable suspicion. This inference is not rendered unreasonable simply because the driver is not always the owner or because Glover's license was revoked. The Court noted that empirical studies and common experience indicate that drivers with revoked licenses frequently continue to drive. Furthermore, Kansas's license revocation scheme, which targets drivers who have demonstrated disregard for the law or are deemed unfit to drive, reinforces the reasonableness of inferring that such an individual might continue to drive.

The Court rejected Glover's arguments that the inference was unreasonable because it was not based on law enforcement training or experience, stating that such a requirement is inconsistent with Fourth Amendment jurisprudence and would unduly burden officers. The Court also dismissed the argument that this approach allows officers to rely exclusively on probabilities, explaining that officers, like jurors, may rely on probabilities, and in this case, the deputy combined database information with commonsense judgments to form reasonable suspicion of specific criminal activity by a specific individual.

The Court emphasized the narrow scope of its holding, reiterating that the reasonable suspicion standard considers the totality of the circumstances. While additional facts could dispel reasonable suspicion, Deputy Mehrer possessed no exculpatory information to rebut the reasonable inference that Glover was driving his own truck. The judgment of the Kansas Supreme Court was reversed, and the case was remanded.

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
## Summary of Kansas v. Glover

### 1. Facts of the Case

The case involves a traffic stop conducted by Deputy Mark Mehrer of the Douglas County Sheriff's Office in Kansas. On April 28, 2016, Deputy Mehrer observed a 1995 Chevrolet 1500 pickup truck with a Kansas license plate. He ran the license plate through the Kansas Department of Revenue's database and discovered that the truck was registered to Charles Glover Jr., whose driver's license had been revoked. Deputy Mehrer assumed that Glover was driving the truck and initiated a traffic stop without observing any traffic infractions. The driver was indeed Glover, who was subsequently charged with driving as a habitual violator.

### 2. Legal Question(s)

The primary legal question addressed by the Supreme Court was whether a police officer violates the Fourth Amendment by initiating an investigative traffic stop after running a vehicle's license plate and learning that the registered owner's driver's license has been revoked.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding

The Supreme Court held that when an officer lacks information negating an inference that the owner is driving the vehicle, an investigative traffic stop made after running a vehicle's license plate and learning that the registered owner's driver's license has been revoked is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. The Court reasoned that the deputy had a ""particularized and objective basis"" to suspect that Glover was driving the vehicle, based on the fact that the vehicle was registered to him and his license had been revoked.

The majority opinion, written by Justice Thomas, emphasized that the reasonable suspicion standard is a ""less demanding"" standard than probable cause and that it ""depends on the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act."" The Court also noted that empirical studies demonstrate that drivers with suspended or revoked licenses frequently continue to drive, and that Kansas' license-revocation scheme covers drivers who have demonstrated a disregard for the law or are categorically unfit to drive.

In a concurring opinion, Justice Kagan highlighted that the key factor in this case was not just that Glover's license was revoked, but that the revocation was likely due to serious or repeated driving offenses, which provides a reason to infer that he might continue to drive.

In contrast, Justice Sotomayor dissented, arguing that the majority's holding ignores key foundations of reasonable-suspicion jurisprudence and reduces the State's burden of proof. She emphasized that the reasonable-suspicion inquiry should be based on the perspectives and inferences of a reasonable officer, not on judicial common sense, and that the State failed to provide articulable facts and officer inferences to form suspicion.

The precedent set by this case is that law enforcement officers may conduct a traffic stop based on the registration of a vehicle to an individual with a revoked license, as long as there is no information available to negate the inference that the registered owner is the driver.

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
### 1. Facts of the Case
Kansas charged respondent Charles Glover, Jr., with driving as a habitual violator under Kan. Stat. Ann. §8–285(a)(3) following a traffic stop. On April 28, 2016, Deputy Mark Mehrer, a certified law enforcement officer with the Douglas County Kansas Sheriff’s Office, observed a 1995 Chevrolet 1500 pickup truck with Kansas plate 295ATJ while on routine patrol in Douglas County. Deputy Mehrer ran the plate through the Kansas Department of Revenue’s file service, confirming the truck was registered to Charles Glover Jr. and that Glover’s driver’s license had been revoked in Kansas. Deputy Mehrer assumed the registered owner was driving, observed no traffic infractions, did not attempt to identify the driver, and initiated the stop solely based on the revoked license information. Glover was identified as the driver. Glover moved to suppress all evidence from the stop, claiming lack of reasonable suspicion. The District Court granted the motion. The Kansas Court of Appeals reversed, holding the inference reasonable (54 Kan. App. 2d 377, 385, 400 P. 3d 182, 188 (2017)). The Kansas Supreme Court reversed, holding the stop violated the Fourth Amendment as the inference was merely a hunch without reasonable suspicion of criminal activity (308 Kan. 590, 591, 422 P. 3d 64, 66 (2018)). Kansas petitioned for certiorari (No. 18–556), which the Supreme Court granted (587 U. S. ___ (2019)).

### 2. Legal Question(s)
Whether a police officer violates the Fourth Amendment by initiating a brief investigative traffic stop after running a vehicle’s license plate, learning that the registered owner’s driver’s license has been revoked, and lacking information negating an inference that the owner is driving the vehicle. The Court addressed whether this scenario provides reasonable suspicion under the Fourth Amendment, which permits stops based on a “particularized and objective basis” for suspecting criminal activity (United States v. Cortez, 449 U. S. 411, 417 (1981); Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 21–22 (1968)), a standard less demanding than probable cause and allowing commonsense judgments and inferences about human behavior (Prado Navarette v. California, 572 U. S. 393, 397, 402 (2014); Illinois v. Wardlow, 528 U. S. 119, 125 (2000)).

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Supreme Court reversed the Kansas Supreme Court (589 U. S. ____ (2020)) in a 8-1 decision delivered by Justice Thomas, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito, Kagan, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh. Justice Kagan filed a concurring opinion joined by Justice Ginsburg; Justice Sotomayor dissented. The Court held that, absent information negating the inference, an investigative traffic stop is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment when an officer runs a license plate, learns the registered owner’s driver’s license is revoked, and infers the owner is driving. Reasoning: The deputy’s commonsense inference from three facts—observation of the truck matching the registered vehicle, plate linked to Glover, and Glover’s revoked license—provided reasonable suspicion, as the standard accounts for factual and practical considerations of everyday life and permits probabilities (Navarette, 572 U. S. at 402; United States v. Sokolow, 490 U. S. 1, 8–9 (1989)). The inference is not unreasonable merely because drivers are not always owners or because revoked drivers sometimes continue driving, as supported by empirical studies (e.g., 75% of suspended/revoked drivers continue driving; 19% of 2008–2012 fatal crash drivers had invalid licenses) and Kansas’s revocation scheme targeting those disregarding law or unfit to drive (Kan. Stat. Ann. §§8–254(a), 8–252, 8–255(a), 8–245(c), 21–6609(c), 8–286, 8–285). Rejected counterarguments: No requirement for law enforcement training/experience (Navarette, 572 U. S. at 402; Wardlow, 528 U. S. at 124; Sokolow, 490 U. S. at 8–9); officers may rely on probabilities, and here facts particularized suspicion to Glover driving with revoked license. Narrow holding: Totality of circumstances governs (Navarette, 572 U. S. at 397); additional facts (e.g., visible mismatch in driver’s age/gender to owner) could dispel suspicion, but none rebutted here. The case was remanded for further proceedings.

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
Facts of the case

In 2012, the Township of Scott, Pennsylvania, passed an ordinance affecting private properties determined to be or contain cemeteries. In relevant part, the ordinance required that ""all cemeteries within the Township … be kept open and accessible to the general public during daylight hours"" and that no owner could unreasonably restrict nor charge any fee to access the cemetery (the ""public-access provision""). Additionally, the ordinance permitted a Township officer to enter any property within the Township to determine whether there is a cemetery on the property, in order to enforce the public-access provision.

Rose Mary Knick owns property in the Township of Scott, and in April 2013, a Township officer entered her property without an administrative warrant and identified certain stones as grave markers. The officer cited Knick as violating the ordinance. Knick disputes that a cemetery exists on her property and filed a lawsuit to challenge.

Knick challenged the ordinance on several grounds, two of which are most salient. First, she alleges that the ordinance authorizes unrestrained searches of private property in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution. Second, she argues that the ordinance takes private property without just compensation, in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Notably, Knick did not initiate an ""inverse-condemnation proceeding"" against the Township, which is the local administrative process for challenging a taking by the government.

The district court dismissed all but two of Knick's claims with prejudice, and dismissed two of them (described above) without prejudice pending exhaustion of state-law remedies. Knick appealed the dismissal of her claims to the Third Circuit. The Third Circuit affirmed the dismissal, finding that although the ordinance was constitutionally suspect, she lacks Article III standing because she failed to demonstrate an injury-in-fact and redressability as to her Fourth Amendment claim, and that her Fifth Amendment claims are not ripe until she has sought and been denied just compensation using state inverse-condemnation procedures as required in the US Supreme Court's 1985 decision in Williamson County Regional Planning Commission v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City.

Question
1. Should the Court affirm or abrogate its holding in Williamson County Regional Planning Commission v. Hamilton Bank, which requires property owners to exhaust state court remedies before bringing federal Takings Clause claims?
2. Does the ripeness doctrine established in Williamson County apply to takings claims that assert that a law is unconstitutional on its face?

Conclusion
A government violates the Takings Clause when it takes property without compensation, and a property owner may bring a Fifth Amendment claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 at that time; the state-litigation requirement set forth in Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U.S. 172 (1985), is overruled.

Chief Justice John Roberts delivered the 5-4 majority opinion for the Court. The Court found that the state-litigation requirement in Williamson County ""imposes an unjustifiable burden on takings plaintiffs"" and ""conflicts with the rest of our takings jurisprudence."" Looking to the text of the Takings Clause, the Court found that the most natural reading of that provision is that the right of compensation arises at the time of the taking. Under Williamson County, the government did not need to compensate in advance or simultaneously with the taking, but only provide a ""reasonable, certain, and adequate"" mechanism for recovering such compensation after the fact. By forcing plaintiffs to seek compensation after the taking in state court before allowing them to proceed in federal court, Williamson County imposes an ""unjustifiable burden"" on these plaintiffs. Additionally, the Court expressed concern over the likelihood that a plaintiff would bring a state-court claim, lose, and therefore be precluded from bringing a claim in federal court at all.

Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate concurrence underscoring his opposition to the position advocated by the township, the United States (as amicus curiae), and the dissent, that there is no constitutional violation as long as there is a mechanism for receiving compensation later.

Justice Elena Kagan dissented, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, and Sonia Sotomayor. Justice Kagan argued that the Takings Clause is at its core (and in its text) different from other constitutional provisions in its qualifying phrase ""without just compensation."" Justice Kagan argued that the Clause does not forbid all takings, only those without just compensation, and the majority disregards the text of the Clause in its interpretation requiring compensation at the time of taking. Justice Kagan also dismissed the majority's concern over the preclusive effect of state-court litigation, arguing that Congress bears the burden of correcting errors that become evident from application of laws. Most importantly, the dissent noted, the majority departs from lost-established precedent and disregards the doctrine of stare decisis.


## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
Here is a summary of the Supreme Court's opinion in *Knick v. Township of Scott, Pennsylvania, et al.*:

### 1. Facts of the Case

Rose Mary Knick owns a 90-acre rural property in Scott Township, Pennsylvania, which includes a small family graveyard. In December 2012, the Township passed an ordinance requiring all cemeteries to be kept open and accessible to the public during daylight hours. A Township officer notified Knick that she was violating this ordinance due to the presence of grave markers on her property.

Knick initiated legal proceedings in state court, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, arguing that the ordinance constituted a taking of her property without just compensation. However, she did not file an inverse condemnation action under state law to seek compensation. In response, the Township withdrew the violation notice and stayed enforcement of the ordinance. The state court declined to rule on Knick's request for equitable relief, finding she could not demonstrate irreparable harm without an ongoing enforcement action.

Subsequently, Knick filed an action in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C. §1983, alleging a violation of the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The District Court dismissed her claim, relying on *Williamson County Regional Planning Comm’n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City*, 473 U.S. 172 (1985), which held that property owners must first seek compensation through state law remedies before bringing a federal takings claim. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed this decision.

### 2. Legal Question(s)

The primary legal question before the Supreme Court was whether a property owner must first seek compensation through state inverse condemnation procedures before bringing a federal takings claim under 42 U.S.C. §1983. This question directly challenged the holding of *Williamson County*.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding

The Supreme Court held that a government violates the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment when it takes property without compensation, and a property owner may bring a Fifth Amendment claim under §1983 at that time. The Court **overruled** the state-litigation requirement established in *Williamson County*.

The Court reasoned that the Fifth Amendment right to just compensation arises at the moment of the taking, regardless of any subsequent state remedies. The *Williamson County* decision, by requiring property owners to first pursue state compensation remedies, created a ""Catch-22"" situation where a failed state claim would be precluded in federal court due to the Full Faith and Credit Statute, thus denying a federal forum for takings claims. The Court found the reasoning in *Williamson County* to be flawed, inconsistent with other takings jurisprudence, and unworkable in practice.

The precedent set by this decision is that property owners can bring a takings claim under §1983 in federal court as soon as their property is taken without just compensation by a local government. This does not preclude governments from acting without immediate payment, as long as adequate post-taking compensation remedies are available, but it ensures that federal courts are accessible for such claims from the outset of the violation.

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
Facts of the case

In 2012, the Township of Scott, Pennsylvania, passed an ordinance affecting private properties determined to be or contain cemeteries. In relevant part, the ordinance required that ""all cemeteries within the Township … be kept open and accessible to the general public during daylight hours"" and that no owner could unreasonably restrict nor charge any fee to access the cemetery (the ""public-access provision""). Additionally, the ordinance permitted a Township officer to enter any property within the Township to determine whether there is a cemetery on the property, in order to enforce the public-access provision.

Rose Mary Knick owns property in the Township of Scott, and in April 2013, a Township officer entered her property without an administrative warrant and identified certain stones as grave markers. The officer cited Knick as violating the ordinance. Knick disputes that a cemetery exists on her property and filed a lawsuit to challenge.

Knick challenged the ordinance on several grounds, two of which are most salient. First, she alleges that the ordinance authorizes unrestrained searches of private property in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution. Second, she argues that the ordinance takes private property without just compensation, in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Notably, Knick did not initiate an ""inverse-condemnation proceeding"" against the Township, which is the local administrative process for challenging a taking by the government.

The district court dismissed all but two of Knick's claims with prejudice, and dismissed two of them (described above) without prejudice pending exhaustion of state-law remedies. Knick appealed the dismissal of her claims to the Third Circuit. The Third Circuit affirmed the dismissal, finding that although the ordinance was constitutionally suspect, she lacks Article III standing because she failed to demonstrate an injury-in-fact and redressability as to her Fourth Amendment claim, and that her Fifth Amendment claims are not ripe until she has sought and been denied just compensation using state inverse-condemnation procedures as required in the US Supreme Court's 1985 decision in Williamson County Regional Planning Commission v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City.

Question
1. Should the Court affirm or abrogate its holding in Williamson County Regional Planning Commission v. Hamilton Bank, which requires property owners to exhaust state court remedies before bringing federal Takings Clause claims?
2. Does the ripeness doctrine established in Williamson County apply to takings claims that assert that a law is unconstitutional on its face?

Conclusion
A government violates the Takings Clause when it takes property without compensation, and a property owner may bring a Fifth Amendment claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 at that time; the state-litigation requirement set forth in Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U.S. 172 (1985), is overruled.

Chief Justice John Roberts delivered the 5-4 majority opinion for the Court. The Court found that the state-litigation requirement in Williamson County ""imposes an unjustifiable burden on takings plaintiffs"" and ""conflicts with the rest of our takings jurisprudence."" Looking to the text of the Takings Clause, the Court found that the most natural reading of that provision is that the right of compensation arises at the time of the taking. Under Williamson County, the government did not need to compensate in advance or simultaneously with the taking, but only provide a ""reasonable, certain, and adequate"" mechanism for recovering such compensation after the fact. By forcing plaintiffs to seek compensation after the taking in state court before allowing them to proceed in federal court, Williamson County imposes an ""unjustifiable burden"" on these plaintiffs. Additionally, the Court expressed concern over the likelihood that a plaintiff would bring a state-court claim, lose, and therefore be precluded from bringing a claim in federal court at all.

Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate concurrence underscoring his opposition to the position advocated by the township, the United States (as amicus curiae), and the dissent, that there is no constitutional violation as long as there is a mechanism for receiving compensation later.

Justice Elena Kagan dissented, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, and Sonia Sotomayor. Justice Kagan argued that the Takings Clause is at its core (and in its text) different from other constitutional provisions in its qualifying phrase ""without just compensation."" Justice Kagan argued that the Clause does not forbid all takings, only those without just compensation, and the majority disregards the text of the Clause in its interpretation requiring compensation at the time of taking. Justice Kagan also dismissed the majority's concern over the preclusive effect of state-court litigation, arguing that Congress bears the burden of correcting errors that become evident from application of laws. Most importantly, the dissent noted, the majority departs from lost-established precedent and disregards the doctrine of stare decisis.


## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
### 1. Facts of the Case
Petitioner Rose Mary Knick owns a 90-acre rural property in Scott Township, Pennsylvania, north of Scranton, which includes her single-family home, grazing areas for horses and farm animals, and a small family graveyard containing ancestors of her neighbors. In December 2012, the Township of Scott passed Ordinance No. 2012–01, requiring that ""[a]ll cemeteries . . . be kept open and accessible to the general public during daylight hours,"" defining a ""cemetery"" as ""[a] place or area of ground, whether contained on private or public property, which has been set apart for or otherwise utilized as a burial place for deceased human beings,"" and authorizing Township code enforcement officers to ""enter upon any property"" to determine the existence and location of a cemetery.

In 2013, a Township officer discovered grave markers on Knick's property and notified her of a violation for failing to open the cemetery to the public during daylight hours. Knick filed suit in Pennsylvania state court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging the ordinance effected a taking of her property without just compensation under the Fifth Amendment, but she did not pursue an inverse condemnation action under Pennsylvania law, 26 Pa. Cons. Stat. §502(c) (2009). The Township withdrew the violation notice and stayed enforcement of the ordinance pending the state proceedings. The state court declined to rule on Knick's request, holding she could not demonstrate irreparable harm absent an ongoing enforcement action.

Knick then filed a complaint under 42 U.S.C. §1983 in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, alleging the ordinance violated the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The District Court dismissed the claim as unripe under Williamson County Regional Planning Comm’n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U.S. 172 (1985), which required property owners to seek compensation through state inverse condemnation procedures before filing a federal takings claim. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed, noting the ordinance was ""extraordinary and constitutionally suspect"" but bound by Williamson County, 862 F.3d 310 (2017). The Supreme Court granted certiorari, 583 U.S. ___ (2018), argued October 3, 2018, reargued January 16, 2019, and decided June 21, 2019.

### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Court addressed whether a property owner may bring a Fifth Amendment Takings Clause claim under 42 U.S.C. §1983 immediately upon a government taking of property without just compensation, or whether, as held in Williamson County Regional Planning Comm’n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U.S. 172 (1985), such a federal claim is premature until the owner has sought and been denied compensation through available state procedures, such as an inverse condemnation action. The Court specifically reconsidered Williamson County's state-litigation requirement, examining its consistency with Takings Clause precedents (e.g., Jacobs v. United States, 290 U.S. 13 (1933); First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U.S. 304 (1987)); its practical consequences, including the preclusive effect under San Remo Hotel, L.P. v. City and County of San Francisco, 545 U.S. 323 (2005), and 28 U.S.C. §1738; and whether it imposed an unjustifiable exhaustion requirement contrary to §1983 jurisprudence (e.g., Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla., 457 U.S. 496 (1982); Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994)).

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Supreme Court held, in a 5-4 decision, that a government violates the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment when it takes property for public use without just compensation, and a property owner may bring a §1983 claim in federal court at that time without first pursuing state remedies. The Court overruled Williamson County’s state-litigation requirement as poorly reasoned, unworkable, and inconsistent with longstanding Takings Clause jurisprudence.

The Court reasoned that the Takings Clause is self-executing, providing a constitutional right to compensation immediately upon an uncompensated taking, as affirmed in Jacobs v. United States, 290 U.S. 13 (1933) (compensation ""rest[s] upon the Fifth Amendment,"" due at time of taking plus interest), and First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U.S. 304 (1987) (""government action that works a taking . . . necessarily implicates the ‘constitutional obligation to pay just compensation’""). Williamson County erroneously treated the Clause as creating only a right to state procedures rather than a direct constitutional violation, drawing flawed analogies from Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U.S. 986 (1984) (federal administrative exhaustion), the Tucker Act (28 U.S.C. §1491(a)(1), itself a Takings Clause remedy), and Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527 (1981) (due process, not takings). It created a ""Catch-22"" via San Remo Hotel’s preclusion of federal claims after state inverse condemnation proceedings. Historical practice and precedents like Cherokee Nation v. Southern Kansas R. Co., 135 U.S. 641 (1890), confirm violations occur at taking but equitable relief (e.g., injunctions) is unavailable if adequate post-deprivation compensation exists, as in nearly all states and under the Tucker Act.

Stare decisis factors—poor reasoning, unworkability (San Remo trap), inconsistency with related decisions, and lack of reliance interests—supported overruling Williamson County, whose rationale had been repeatedly recast. Governments face no new liability or injunction risk, as compensation remedies foreclose equitable relief. The judgment of the Third Circuit was vacated and remanded. Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion, joined by Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh; Justice Thomas concurred; Justice Kagan dissented, joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor.

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
Facts of the case

In 2010, for the first time in over forty years, Wisconsin voters elected a Republican majority in the state assembly and the senate, and a Republican governor. As a result, the Republican leadership developed a voting district map that its drafters calculated would allow Republicans to maintain a majority under any likely voting scenario. The redistricting plan was introduced in July 2011, and both the senate and the assembly passed the bill shortly thereafter. The governor signed the bill into law in August 2011. Even before it was enacted, the plan faced two legal challenges, on constitutional and statutory grounds. A federal court upheld the plan as not violating the ""one person one vote"" principle nor violating the Equal Protection Clause.

Plaintiffs in this case challenge the plan as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. At issue is whether the plan systematically dilutes the voting strength of Democratic voters statewide.

Question
1. Did the district court err in holding that it had the authority to hear a statewide challenge to Wisconsin's redistricting plan, rather than requiring a district-by-district analysis?
2. Did the district court err in holding that the redistricting plan was an unconstitutional gerrymander?
3. Did the district court use an incorrect test for a gerrymander?
4. Are defendants entitled to present evidence that they would have prevailed under the gerrymander test actually used by the district court?
5. Are partisan gerrymandering claims justiciable?

Conclusion
The plaintiffs failed to demonstrate Article III standing, so there is no need to resolve any of the questions presented. In a unanimous decision authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Court sidestepped (for now) all of the key issues regarding partisan gerrymandering, resolving the case instead on the technical issue of judicial standing. For a plaintiff to bring a case in federal court, she must have Article III standing, which requires showing three elements, one of which is ""injury in fact."" To show injury in fact, a plaintiff must show that she has suffered ""invasion of a legally protected interest"" that is ""concrete and particularized."" In this case, the Court found that the plaintiffs alleged but did not prove individual harms, providing evidence instead only of statewide harms of alleged partisan gerrymandering. The Court thus vacated the judgment of the district court and remanded for further proceedings.

Justice Clarence Thomas filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, in which Justice Neil Gorsuch joined. Justices Thomas and Gorsuch did not join the majority with respect to the decision to remand the case and allow the plaintiffs a second chance to prove standing and thus wrote separately to express this disagreement with the disposition.

Justice Elena Kagan filed a concurring opinion in which Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, and Sonia Sotomayor joined. Justice Kagan agreed with the findings and conclusions of the Court but wrote separately, in essence, to describe how the plaintiffs might proceed upon remand. Justice Kagan suggests that the plaintiffs might present more than simply a vote dilution theory, but also an infringement of their First Amendment right of association. Such a claim, according to Justice Kagan, would not require the plaintiffs to show injury-in-fact in the form of injury to her particular voting district because that claim would be statewide in nature. She predicts that partisan gerrymandering ""injures enough individuals and organizations in enough concrete ways . . . that standing requirements, properly applied, will not often or long prevent courts from reaching the merits of cases like this one.""


## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
Here is a summary of the Supreme Court's opinion in *Gill et al. v. Whitford et al.*:

### 1. Facts of the Case

This case originated with a lawsuit filed by twelve Democratic voters in Wisconsin against members of the state election commission. The voters alleged that Wisconsin's legislative redistricting plan, enacted as Act 43 following the 2010 census, constituted an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. They claimed that Act 43 harmed the Democratic Party's ability to translate votes into legislative seats by ""cracking"" Democratic voters into districts where they could not achieve a majority and ""packing"" them into districts where their votes were in overwhelming excess of what was needed to win. The voters asserted that this practice violated their First Amendment right of association and their Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection.

The defendants moved to dismiss, arguing that the plaintiffs, as individual voters, lacked standing to challenge the statewide redistricting plan because their legally protected interests were limited to the district in which they voted. A three-judge District Court denied the motion to dismiss, finding that the plaintiffs had suffered a particularized injury to their equal protection rights. After a trial, the District Court concluded that Act 43 was an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. The defendants appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

### 2. Legal Question(s)

The primary legal question before the Supreme Court was whether the plaintiffs had demonstrated Article III standing to challenge Wisconsin's legislative redistricting plan, Act 43, as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. Specifically, the Court considered whether the alleged harms constituted a concrete and particularized injury to the plaintiffs' individual rights, as required for federal court jurisdiction.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding

The Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate Article III standing. The Court vacated the judgment of the District Court and remanded the case.

The Court reasoned that for a plaintiff to have standing, they must show an ""injury in fact"" that is concrete and particularized, affecting them in a personal and individual way. While the right to vote is individual, the Court found that the alleged harm from partisan gerrymandering, specifically through ""packing"" and ""cracking,"" is district-specific. An individual voter's injury arises from the boundaries of their own district and the composition of its voters. Therefore, a plaintiff complaining of gerrymandering must typically demonstrate how their own vote has been burdened within their specific district.

The Court found that the plaintiffs' claims, as presented at trial, focused on a statewide injury to Wisconsin Democrats and their collective interests, rather than on specific, individual harms to their own votes. The evidence presented, such as testimony about the mapmakers' intent and partisan-asymmetry studies (like the ""efficiency gap""), measured the effect of the gerrymander on political parties statewide, not on the votes of particular citizens. While four plaintiffs initially alleged they lived in packed or cracked districts, they failed to prove this individual harm at trial.

However, because the Court recognized that partisan gerrymandering claims involve unsettled legal questions and the plaintiffs had alleged that specific individuals lived in packed or cracked districts, it remanded the case. This remand provided the plaintiffs an opportunity to present evidence demonstrating concrete and particularized injuries that tend to show a burden on their individual votes. The Court emphasized that any remedy must be tailored to the specific injury established.

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
Facts of the case

In 2010, for the first time in over forty years, Wisconsin voters elected a Republican majority in the state assembly and the senate, and a Republican governor. As a result, the Republican leadership developed a voting district map that its drafters calculated would allow Republicans to maintain a majority under any likely voting scenario. The redistricting plan was introduced in July 2011, and both the senate and the assembly passed the bill shortly thereafter. The governor signed the bill into law in August 2011. Even before it was enacted, the plan faced two legal challenges, on constitutional and statutory grounds. A federal court upheld the plan as not violating the ""one person one vote"" principle nor violating the Equal Protection Clause.

Plaintiffs in this case challenge the plan as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. At issue is whether the plan systematically dilutes the voting strength of Democratic voters statewide.

Question
1. Did the district court err in holding that it had the authority to hear a statewide challenge to Wisconsin's redistricting plan, rather than requiring a district-by-district analysis?
2. Did the district court err in holding that the redistricting plan was an unconstitutional gerrymander?
3. Did the district court use an incorrect test for a gerrymander?
4. Are defendants entitled to present evidence that they would have prevailed under the gerrymander test actually used by the district court?
5. Are partisan gerrymandering claims justiciable?

Conclusion
The plaintiffs failed to demonstrate Article III standing, so there is no need to resolve any of the questions presented. In a unanimous decision authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Court sidestepped (for now) all of the key issues regarding partisan gerrymandering, resolving the case instead on the technical issue of judicial standing. For a plaintiff to bring a case in federal court, she must have Article III standing, which requires showing three elements, one of which is ""injury in fact."" To show injury in fact, a plaintiff must show that she has suffered ""invasion of a legally protected interest"" that is ""concrete and particularized."" In this case, the Court found that the plaintiffs alleged but did not prove individual harms, providing evidence instead only of statewide harms of alleged partisan gerrymandering. The Court thus vacated the judgment of the district court and remanded for further proceedings.

Justice Clarence Thomas filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, in which Justice Neil Gorsuch joined. Justices Thomas and Gorsuch did not join the majority with respect to the decision to remand the case and allow the plaintiffs a second chance to prove standing and thus wrote separately to express this disagreement with the disposition.

Justice Elena Kagan filed a concurring opinion in which Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, and Sonia Sotomayor joined. Justice Kagan agreed with the findings and conclusions of the Court but wrote separately, in essence, to describe how the plaintiffs might proceed upon remand. Justice Kagan suggests that the plaintiffs might present more than simply a vote dilution theory, but also an infringement of their First Amendment right of association. Such a claim, according to Justice Kagan, would not require the plaintiffs to show injury-in-fact in the form of injury to her particular voting district because that claim would be statewide in nature. She predicts that partisan gerrymandering ""injures enough individuals and organizations in enough concrete ways . . . that standing requirements, properly applied, will not often or long prevent courts from reaching the merits of cases like this one.""


## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
### Summary of Gill v. Whitford (2018)

#### 1. Facts of the Case
The case involves a challenge to Wisconsin's 2011 state legislative redistricting plan, known as Act 43, which was enacted by a Republican-controlled legislature and signed into law by a Republican governor. Twelve Democratic voters alleged that Act 43 was a partisan gerrymander designed to disadvantage Democratic voters by ""cracking"" and ""packing"" them into districts. The plaintiffs claimed that this gerrymandering violated their First Amendment right of association and their Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection. The case was heard by a three-judge District Court, which ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, finding Act 43 unconstitutional. The defendants, members of the state election commission, appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

#### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Supreme Court addressed the question of whether the plaintiffs had standing to challenge Act 43. Specifically, the Court considered whether the plaintiffs had suffered a particularized injury due to the alleged partisan gerrymandering and whether their claimed harm was sufficiently concrete and individualized to satisfy Article III standing requirements.

#### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate Article III standing because they did not prove that they suffered a particularized injury. The Court ruled that to establish standing in a partisan gerrymandering case based on vote dilution, a plaintiff must show that their individual vote was diluted due to being ""cracked"" or ""packed"" in their specific district. The Court found that while four plaintiffs alleged such particularized burdens in their complaint, they failed to pursue these allegations at trial and instead relied on a theory of statewide injury. The Court vacated the District Court's judgment and remanded the case, giving the plaintiffs an opportunity to prove concrete and particularized injuries. The Court's decision emphasizes that a plaintiff's remedy must be tailored to redress their particular injury, and it leaves open the possibility of considering other theories of harm and justiciability in future cases.

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
### 1. Facts of the Case
Wisconsin elects members of its State Legislature from single-member districts, with the legislature required by the Wisconsin Constitution to redraw district boundaries following each census. After the 2010 census, a Republican-controlled legislature passed, and a Republican governor signed, a new districting plan known as Act 43 (Wis. Stat. §§ 4.009, 4.01–4.99; 2011 Wis. Laws ch. 4). Under Act 43, Republicans won majorities in the State Assembly in the 2012 election (60 seats with 48.6% of the two-party statewide vote) and the 2014 election (63 seats with 52% of the statewide vote).

In July 2015, twelve Democratic voters, including lead plaintiff William Whitford (a resident of heavily Democratic Assembly District 76), filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin against several members of the state election commission (appellants Beverly R. Gill et al.). The plaintiffs (appellees William Whitford et al.) alleged that Act 43 constituted an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander that harmed the Democratic Party's ability to translate votes into legislative seats through ""cracking"" (dividing Democratic voters among districts where they fail to achieve majorities) and ""packing"" (concentrating Democratic voters into a few districts won by large margins). They claimed this violated their First Amendment right of association and Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection, as measured by an ""efficiency gap"" metric comparing each party's ""wasted votes"" (votes for losing candidates or excess votes for winning candidates beyond what is needed to win) across all districts. Four plaintiffs—Mary Lynne Donohue (District 26), Wendy Sue Johnson, Janet Mitchell, and Jerome Wallace—specifically alleged packing or cracking in their own districts.

The defendants moved to dismiss for lack of standing, arguing that individual voters' interests are limited to their own districts. A three-judge District Court denied the motion (Whitford v. Nichol, 151 F. Supp. 3d 918 (WD Wis. 2015)), held a trial, and ruled Act 43 unconstitutional under a three-part test: (1) intent to impede effectiveness of votes based on political affiliation; (2) that effect; and (3) no legitimate justification (218 F. Supp. 3d 837 (WD Wis. 2016)). The court found a cognizable statewide equal protection injury to Democratic voters, enjoined Act 43's use, and ordered a remedial plan by November 1, 2017. The defendants appealed directly to the Supreme Court under 28 U.S.C. §1253, which stayed the judgment (582 U.S. ___ (2017)).

### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Court addressed whether the plaintiffs demonstrated Article III standing to challenge the statewide constitutionality of Act 43, specifically whether they showed a particularized ""injury in fact""—an invasion of a legally protected interest that is concrete and particularized, affecting them in a personal and individual way (Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560, and n. 1 (1992))—arising from alleged vote dilution via partisan gerrymandering. The Court considered whether the alleged statewide harm to Democrats (measured by efficiency gap and partisan asymmetry) or to collective representation constituted such an injury, or whether any injury was district-specific, and distinguished prior cases on malapportionment (Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962); Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964)) and racial gerrymandering (United States v. Hays, 515 U.S. 737 (1995); Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, 575 U.S. ___ (2015)). The Court did not reach the justiciability of partisan gerrymandering claims or the merits.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Supreme Court held unanimously that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate Article III standing and vacated the District Court's judgment (218 F. Supp. 3d 837), remanding for further proceedings rather than directing dismissal, given the unsettled nature of partisan gerrymandering claims.

Chief Justice Roberts's opinion (joined by Kennedy, Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito, Sotomayor, and Kagan JJ.; Thomas and Gorsuch JJ. joined except Part III) reasoned that partisan gerrymandering injury, if any, from vote dilution is district-specific because a voter resides in and votes in only one district, where boundaries and voter composition determine packing or cracking; a voter outside a gerrymandered district asserts only a generalized grievance (Hays, 515 U.S. at 745). Statewide claims analogized to malapportionment cases (Baker; Reynolds) fail because those injuries were individual (unequal vote weight), remedied district-by-district, not statewide group harm to party fortunes or legislative composition, which is a nonjusticiable generalized grievance (Lance v. Coffman, 549 U.S. 437 (2007); Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 357 (1996)). Four plaintiffs alleged but did not prove district-specific harm at trial; evidence offered—Whitford's testimony on desiring a Democratic majority; mapmakers' partisan deliberations (e.g., ""S curves""); and efficiency gap/partisan asymmetry studies—measured group/party effects, not individual vote burdens, and thus insufficient for standing (Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 560).

The Court set no binding precedent on justiciability or merits of partisan gerrymandering but reaffirmed that standing requires proof of concrete, particularized, district-specific injury for vote dilution claims (distinguishing Gaffney v. Cummings, 412 U.S. 735 (1973); Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U.S. 109 (1986); Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U.S. 267 (2004); League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399 (2006)); remedies must be tailored to proven injury; and left open other theories (e.g., associational harm). Justice Kagan (joined by Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor JJ.) concurred, elaborating standing proof for vote dilution (e.g., alternative maps) and associational claims. Justice Thomas (joined by Gorsuch J.) concurred in part, advocating remand with dismissal instructions.

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
Facts of the case

Encino Motorcars, LLC, which sells and services Mercedes-Benz cars, employed Hector Navarro and others as ""service advisors."" Their role was to greet car owners upon arrival in the service area of the dealership, listen to customers' concerns about their cars, evaluate the repair and maintenance needs of the cars, suggest services, write up estimates, and follow up with the customer while repair work was being done.

Navarro and the other plaintiffs alleged in federal district court that Encino Motorcars violated the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) by failing to pay them overtime wages. The district court dismissed the claim, finding that the FLSA exempts service advisors from its overtime compensation provisions. A panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed, using the principle of Chevron deference to rely on a regulation promulgated by the Department of Labor in 2011 interpreting the statutory exemption as not encompassing service providers. The US Supreme Court vacated the panel's decision, holding that the regulation lacked sufficient explanation and thus was not entitled to deference. On remand, the Ninth Circuit formulated its own interpretation of the applicable FLSA provision and concluded that the exemption does not encompass service advisors.

Question
Are service advisors at car dealerships exempt under 29 U.S.C. § 213(b)(10)(A) from the Fair Labor Standards Act's overtime-pay requirements?

Conclusion
In a 5-4 decision, the Court reversed and remanded the case back to the Ninth Circuit, holding that because service advisors at car dealerships are ""salesm[e]n . . . primarily engaged in . . . servicing automobiles,"" 29 U.S.C. § 213(b)(10)(A), they are exempt from the FLSA's overtime-pay requirements.

Construing the relevant portions of the statute, the Court explained that a service advisor is clearly a ""salesman"" who sells services to customers for their vehicles. The Court also concluded that service advisors are ""primarily engaged in . . . servicing automobiles"" since they are integral in the process of providing maintenance and repair services to customers, even if they do not spend most of their time physically repairing vehicles. The Court rejected the Ninth Circuit's use of the distributive canon, as well as its conclusion that FLSA exemptions should be construed narrowly in holding that service advisors were not exempt. It also rejected the appellate court's reliance on a 1966-67 DOL Occupational Outlook Handbook and the FLSA legislative history, both of which the Court found unpersuasive.

Justice Ginsburg filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan joined.


## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
Here is a summary of the Supreme Court's opinion in *Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro et al.*:

**1. Facts of the Case**

Respondents, who were current and former service advisors for petitioner Encino Motorcars, LLC, filed a lawsuit alleging that Encino Motorcars violated the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) by failing to pay them overtime wages. Encino Motorcars moved to dismiss the suit, arguing that service advisors are exempt from the FLSA's overtime pay requirement under 29 U.S.C. §213(b)(10)(A). This exemption applies to ""any salesman, partsman, or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or servicing automobiles, trucks, or farm implements."" The District Court dismissed the suit, agreeing with Encino Motorcars.

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, finding the statute ambiguous and the legislative history inconclusive. It deferred to a 2011 Department of Labor rule that interpreted ""salesman"" to exclude service advisors. The Supreme Court vacated the Ninth Circuit's judgment in *Encino I*, holding that courts could not defer to the procedurally defective 2011 rule, but it did not decide whether the exemption actually covered service advisors. The case was remanded to the Ninth Circuit.

On remand, the Ninth Circuit again ruled that the exemption does not include service advisors. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review this decision.

**2. Legal Question(s)**

The primary legal question before the Supreme Court was whether service advisors at automobile dealerships are considered ""salesmen . . . primarily engaged in . . . servicing automobiles"" and are therefore exempt from the overtime pay requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) under 29 U.S.C. §213(b)(10)(A).

**3. Conclusion/Holding**

The Supreme Court held that service advisors are indeed ""salesmen . . . primarily engaged in . . . servicing automobiles"" and are thus exempt from the FLSA's overtime-pay requirement.

The Court reasoned as follows:
*   **""Salesman""**: The ordinary meaning of ""salesman"" is someone who sells goods or services. Service advisors sell services for vehicles to customers, fitting this definition.
*   **""Primarily engaged in . . . servicing automobiles""**: The term ""servicing"" can mean either maintaining or repairing a vehicle, or providing a service. Service advisors are integral to the servicing process, as they meet customers, listen to concerns, suggest services, sell accessories or parts, record orders, follow up, and explain work. The Court noted that partsmen, who are agreed to be exempt, also do not spend most of their time physically repairing cars but are considered integral to servicing.
*   **Statutory Interpretation**: The Court rejected the Ninth Circuit's reliance on the distributive canon, which would have matched ""salesman"" with ""selling"" and ""partsman"" or ""mechanic"" with ""servicing."" The Court emphasized that the word ""or"" in the statute is disjunctive, meaning the exemption covers a salesman primarily engaged in either selling *or* servicing. The Court found that the statutory context, including the use of ""any"" and multiple instances of ""or,"" indicated a broad exemption, and that a ""salesman . . . primarily engaged in . . . servicing automobiles"" is an apt description of a service advisor.
*   **Narrow Construction of Exemptions**: The Court rejected the principle that FLSA exemptions should be construed narrowly, stating that exemptions should be given a ""fair reading"" unless the statute provides a textual indication otherwise. The Court reasoned that exemptions are as much a part of the FLSA's purpose as its remedial provisions.
*   **Extraneous Sources**: The Court found the Ninth Circuit's reliance on the Occupational Outlook Handbook and legislative history unpersuasive. The Handbook did not dictate the scope of the exemption, and silence in the legislative history cannot override a clear reading of the statutory text.

The Court reversed the judgment of the Ninth Circuit and remanded the case for further proceedings.

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
Facts of the case

Encino Motorcars, LLC, which sells and services Mercedes-Benz cars, employed Hector Navarro and others as ""service advisors."" Their role was to greet car owners upon arrival in the service area of the dealership, listen to customers' concerns about their cars, evaluate the repair and maintenance needs of the cars, suggest services, write up estimates, and follow up with the customer while repair work was being done.

Navarro and the other plaintiffs alleged in federal district court that Encino Motorcars violated the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) by failing to pay them overtime wages. The district court dismissed the claim, finding that the FLSA exempts service advisors from its overtime compensation provisions. A panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed, using the principle of Chevron deference to rely on a regulation promulgated by the Department of Labor in 2011 interpreting the statutory exemption as not encompassing service providers. The US Supreme Court vacated the panel's decision, holding that the regulation lacked sufficient explanation and thus was not entitled to deference. On remand, the Ninth Circuit formulated its own interpretation of the applicable FLSA provision and concluded that the exemption does not encompass service advisors.

Question
Are service advisors at car dealerships exempt under 29 U.S.C. § 213(b)(10)(A) from the Fair Labor Standards Act's overtime-pay requirements?

Conclusion
In a 5-4 decision, the Court reversed and remanded the case back to the Ninth Circuit, holding that because service advisors at car dealerships are ""salesm[e]n . . . primarily engaged in . . . servicing automobiles,"" 29 U.S.C. § 213(b)(10)(A), they are exempt from the FLSA's overtime-pay requirements.

Construing the relevant portions of the statute, the Court explained that a service advisor is clearly a ""salesman"" who sells services to customers for their vehicles. The Court also concluded that service advisors are ""primarily engaged in . . . servicing automobiles"" since they are integral in the process of providing maintenance and repair services to customers, even if they do not spend most of their time physically repairing vehicles. The Court rejected the Ninth Circuit's use of the distributive canon, as well as its conclusion that FLSA exemptions should be construed narrowly in holding that service advisors were not exempt. It also rejected the appellate court's reliance on a 1966-67 DOL Occupational Outlook Handbook and the FLSA legislative history, both of which the Court found unpersuasive.

Justice Ginsburg filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan joined.


## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
### Summary of Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro

#### 1. Facts of the Case
The case involves Encino Motorcars, LLC, a Mercedes-Benz dealership in California, and its current and former service advisors, who sued the company for backpay, alleging a violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) due to the failure to pay overtime. The service advisors' primary duties include meeting customers, listening to their concerns, suggesting repair and maintenance services, selling new accessories or replacement parts, recording service orders, following up with customers, and explaining the repair work. The District Court initially dismissed the suit, ruling that service advisors are exempt from the FLSA's overtime-pay requirement under 29 U.S.C. §213(b)(10)(A). The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this decision, deferring to a 2011 Department of Labor rule that interpreted ""salesman"" to exclude service advisors. The Supreme Court vacated the Ninth Circuit's judgment in Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro (Encino I), holding that the 2011 rule was procedurally defective and thus not entitled to deference. On remand, the Ninth Circuit again ruled that service advisors are not exempt.

#### 2. Legal Question(s)
The specific legal question addressed by the Court was whether service advisors at car dealerships are exempt from the FLSA's overtime-pay requirement under 29 U.S.C. §213(b)(10)(A), which exempts ""any salesman, partsman, or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or servicing automobiles, trucks, or farm implements.""

#### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Supreme Court held that service advisors are indeed exempt from the FLSA's overtime-pay requirement because they are ""salesmen primarily engaged in servicing automobiles."" The Court reasoned that the term ""salesman"" includes service advisors as they sell services to customers. Furthermore, service advisors are ""primarily engaged in servicing automobiles"" as they are integral to the servicing process, even though they do not physically repair automobiles. The Court rejected the Ninth Circuit's application of the distributive canon, which would have limited the exemption to salesmen engaged in selling automobiles. Instead, the Court applied a disjunctive reading of ""or"" in the statute, concluding that a salesman can be exempt if primarily engaged in either selling or servicing automobiles. The Court also rejected the principle that FLSA exemptions should be construed narrowly, stating that exemptions should be given a fair reading. The decision reversed the Ninth Circuit's judgment and remanded the case.

## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
### 1. Facts of the Case
Encino Motorcars, LLC, a Mercedes-Benz dealership in California (petitioner), employed Hector Navarro et al. (respondents), current and former service advisors. Service advisors interact with customers, sell them services for their vehicles, meet customers, listen to concerns, suggest repair and maintenance services, sell new accessories or replacement parts, record service orders, follow up as services are performed, and explain repair work upon vehicle return. In 2012, respondents sued petitioner in the District Court for backpay, alleging violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. §207(a), by failing to pay overtime, claiming they were not exempt under 29 U.S.C. §213(b)(10)(A). Petitioner moved to dismiss, arguing exemption. The District Court agreed and dismissed. The Ninth Circuit reversed, deferring under Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), to a 2011 Department of Labor (DOL) rule, 76 Fed. Reg. 18832 (codified at 29 CFR §779.372(c)), interpreting ""salesman"" to exclude service advisors; see Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 780 F.3d 1267 (2015). The Supreme Court vacated and remanded in Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro (Encino I), 579 U.S. ___ (2016), holding no deference due to the 2011 rule's procedural defect but not deciding exemption coverage. On remand, the Ninth Circuit again reversed, holding service advisors not exempt; 845 F.3d 925 (2017). The Supreme Court granted certiorari, 582 U.S. ___ (2017).

### 2. Legal Question(s)
Whether service advisors at car dealerships are exempt from the FLSA's overtime-pay requirement under 29 U.S.C. §213(b)(10)(A), which exempts ""any salesman, partsman, or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or servicing automobiles, trucks, or farm implements, if he is employed by a nonmanufacturing establishment primarily engaged in the business of selling such vehicles or implements to ultimate purchasers."" The parties agreed petitioner qualified as such an establishment, respondents were not partsmen or mechanics, and respondents were not primarily engaged in selling automobiles.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit and held that service advisors are exempt under §213(b)(10)(A) as ""salesm[e]n . . . primarily engaged in . . . servicing automobiles."" Justice Thomas delivered the opinion for the Court, joined by Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Kennedy, Justice Alito, and Justice Gorsuch; Justice Ginsburg dissented, joined by Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan.

Reasoning: (a) ""Salesman"" has its ordinary meaning as someone who sells goods or services (14 Oxford English Dictionary 391 (2d ed. 1989); Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1262 (1966)), and service advisors sell customers services for their vehicles. (b) Service advisors are ""primarily engaged in . . . servicing automobiles,"" as ""servicing"" means ""the action of maintaining or repairing a motor vehicle"" or ""the action of providing a service"" (15 Oxford English Dictionary 39); they are integral to the process, like partsmen (who do not physically repair vehicles but obtain and provide parts; 1 Dept. of Labor, Dictionary of Occupational Titles 33 (3d ed. 1965)). (c) The Ninth Circuit's distributive canon (matching ""salesman"" with ""selling"" and ""partsman/mechanic"" with ""servicing"") fails because ""or"" connecting nouns and gerunds is disjunctive (United States v. Woods, 571 U.S. 31, 45 (2013)); context favors this: no one-to-one matching of three nouns with two gerunds; disjunctive reading linguistically possible and apt for service advisors; exemption's breadth (""any,"" three ""or""s) supports any combination (Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.S. 214, 219 (2008); Brown v. Gardner, 513 U.S. 115, 118 (1994)). (d) FLSA exemptions receive a fair reading, not narrow construction, absent textual indication otherwise. (e) DOL's 1966–1967 Occupational Outlook Handbook and FLSA legislative history (silence on service advisors) are unpersuasive; text controls (Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 495, n.13 (1985)).

Precedent set: Service advisors are exempt from FLSA overtime; exemptions interpreted by fair reading of text, not narrow construction; no deference to procedurally defective agency rules (Encino I); reversed and remanded, 584 U.S. ___ (2018).

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
Facts of the case

Epic Systems Corporation (Epic) is a Wisconsin-based healthcare data management software company. Epic has an arbitration agreement that requires its employees to resolve any employment-based disputes with Epic through individual arbitration and to waive their right to participate in or receive benefit from any class, collective, or representative proceedings. In February 2015, former Epic employee Jacob Lewis sued Epic in federal court individually and on behalf of similarly-situated employees and claimed that they had been denied overtime wages in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Epic moved to dismiss the complaint and cited the waiver clause of its arbitration agreement. The district court denied Epic's motion and held that the waiver was unenforceable because it violated the right of employees to engage in ""concerted activities"" under Section Seven of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the lower court's decision and added that the waiver was also unenforceable under the savings clause of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). That clause provides that arbitration agreements are to be enforced unless there legal or equitable grounds that would render a contract unenforceable. Finding the waiver of collective proceedings illegal under the NLRA, the appellate court held that the arbitration agreement was unenforceable under the FAA. This case was consolidated with Ernst & Young v. Morris and National Labor Relations Board v. Murphy Oil USA, Inc., both cases that dealt with the relationship between the FAA and the NLRA.

Question
Does the National Labor Relations Act prohibit enforcement of an agreement requiring employees to resolve disputes with the employer through individual arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act?

Conclusion
The Court held that neither the Arbitration Act's saving clause nor the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) supersede Congress's instructions in the Federal Arbitration Act that arbitration agreements providing for individualized proceedings must be enforced. Justice Neil Gorsuch delivered the opinion for a 5-4 majority. The majority found that the Federal Arbitration Act ""instructed federal courts to enforce arbitration agreements according to their terms"" and that the NLRA ""does not mention class or collection action procedures"" and thus cannot be read to displace the Arbitration Act.

Justice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion to add that ""the employees also cannot prevail under the plain meaning of the Federal Arbitration Act.""

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan joined. The dissent noted the extreme imbalance between employer and employee and Congress's attempt to remedy that imbalance in passing the NLRA and its forerunner, the Norris-LaGuardia Act. In this context, the dissent found that the Federal Arbitration Act should not shrink the NLRA's ""protective sphere.""


## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
Here is a summary of the Supreme Court's opinion in *Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis*:

## Summary of *Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis*

### 1. Facts of the Case

This case consolidated three separate lawsuits brought by employees against their employers. In each instance, the employees had entered into employment contracts that included mandatory arbitration clauses requiring that any disputes be resolved through individualized arbitration proceedings. Despite these agreements, the employees sought to litigate claims related to wage and hour laws, specifically the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and related state laws, through class or collective actions in federal court. The employers moved to compel arbitration based on the agreements. The employees argued that these arbitration agreements, by mandating individualized proceedings and prohibiting class or collective actions, violated the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and therefore should not be enforced under the ""saving clause"" of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) had previously taken the position that the NLRA effectively nullified the FAA in such cases, a position that had been adopted by some lower courts. However, the Executive Branch, through the Solicitor General, presented a different view. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve this conflict.

### 2. Legal Question(s)

The central legal question before the Supreme Court was whether employment contracts requiring individualized arbitration, thereby precluding employees from bringing class or collective actions, are enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act, or if such agreements are rendered unlawful by the National Labor Relations Act.

Specifically, the Court addressed:
* Whether the ""saving clause"" of the Federal Arbitration Act, which allows for the revocation of arbitration agreements on grounds applicable to any contract, permits the refusal to enforce arbitration agreements that mandate individualized proceedings based on a claim that such provisions violate the National Labor Relations Act.
* Whether the National Labor Relations Act, through its provisions protecting employees' rights to engage in ""concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection,"" implicitly prohibits employers from requiring employees to waive their right to participate in class or collective actions in arbitration or litigation.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding

The Supreme Court held that Congress has instructed, through the Federal Arbitration Act, that arbitration agreements providing for individualized proceedings must be enforced as written. The Court ruled that neither the FAA's saving clause nor the NLRA provides a basis for invalidating these agreements.

The Court reasoned that the FAA establishes a strong federal policy favoring arbitration and requires courts to enforce arbitration agreements according to their terms. The saving clause of the FAA allows for the revocation of arbitration agreements only on grounds that apply to contracts generally, such as fraud or unconscionability, and not on defenses that specifically target arbitration or interfere with its fundamental attributes. The Court found that prohibiting individualized arbitration proceedings, as the employees argued, directly interferes with a fundamental attribute of arbitration.

Furthermore, the Court concluded that the NLRA does not conflict with the FAA. Section 7 of the NLRA protects employees' rights to organize and engage in collective bargaining and other concerted activities. However, the Court found no clear and manifest congressional intent within the NLRA to displace the FAA or to create a right to class or collective action procedures in litigation or arbitration. The Court noted that the NLRA was enacted before modern class action procedures were well-developed and that the phrase ""other concerted activities"" should be interpreted in context with the specific activities listed, which relate to unionization and collective bargaining, not procedural rights in court or arbitration. The Court also emphasized the strong presumption against implied repeals of statutes and the need to interpret statutes harmoniously. The Court found no basis to defer to the NLRB's interpretation, as the agency sought to interpret one statute in a way that limited the scope of another statute it did not administer, and the Executive Branch itself presented conflicting views.

Therefore, the Court reversed the judgments in *Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis* (No. 16–285) and *Ernst & Young LLP v. Morris* (No. 16–300), and affirmed the judgment in *National Labor Relations Board v. Murphy Oil USA, Inc.* (No. 16–307), holding that employment agreements requiring individualized arbitration are enforceable.

The majority found that the Federal Arbitration Act ""instructed federal courts to enforce arbitration agreements according to their terms"" and that the NLRA ""does not mention class or collection action procedures"" and thus cannot be read to displace the Arbitration Act.

Justice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion to add that ""the employees also cannot prevail under the plain meaning of the Federal Arbitration Act.""

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan joined. The dissent noted the extreme imbalance between employer and employee and Congress's attempt to remedy that imbalance in passing the NLRA and its forerunner, the Norris-LaGuardia Act. In this context, the dissent found that the Federal Arbitration Act should not shrink the NLRA's ""protective sphere.""


## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
### 1. Facts of the Case

The cases before the Supreme Court involve employees who entered into arbitration agreements with their employers, requiring individualized arbitration proceedings to resolve employment disputes. Despite these agreements, the employees sought to litigate Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and related state law claims through class or collective actions in federal court. The employers countered with motions to compel arbitration based on the agreements. The employees argued that the arbitration agreements violated the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) by barring class or collective actions, which they claimed were ""concerted activities"" protected under §7 of the NLRA. The courts of appeals were divided on whether the NLRA rendered such arbitration agreements unenforceable, leading to the Supreme Court granting certiorari to resolve the conflict.

### 2. Legal Question(s)

The specific legal questions addressed by the Court were:
1. Whether the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) requires enforcement of arbitration agreements that mandate individualized proceedings.
2. Whether the NLRA overrides the FAA by protecting employees' rights to engage in class or collective actions.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding

The Supreme Court held that the FAA requires enforcement of arbitration agreements according to their terms, including those that specify individualized proceedings. The Court found that the NLRA does not conflict with the FAA on this matter because §7 of the NLRA, which protects ""concerted activities,"" does not clearly and manifestly intend to displace the FAA or guarantee a right to class or collective actions. The Court applied the principle of statutory construction that favors giving effect to both statutes where possible and held that the NLRA and FAA can coexist without conflict. The Court's reasoning was based on the text, structure, and history of the NLRA, as well as relevant precedent. The decision effectively means that employers can enforce arbitration agreements that bar class or collective actions, limiting employees to individualized arbitration for resolving certain employment disputes.

The Court's ruling was 5-4, with Justice Gorsuch delivering the majority opinion joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito. Justice Thomas also filed a concurring opinion, and Justice Ginsburg filed a dissenting opinion joined by Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan.

## REFERENCE SUMMARY (Ground Truth):
Facts of the case

Epic Systems Corporation (Epic) is a Wisconsin-based healthcare data management software company. Epic has an arbitration agreement that requires its employees to resolve any employment-based disputes with Epic through individual arbitration and to waive their right to participate in or receive benefit from any class, collective, or representative proceedings. In February 2015, former Epic employee Jacob Lewis sued Epic in federal court individually and on behalf of similarly-situated employees and claimed that they had been denied overtime wages in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Epic moved to dismiss the complaint and cited the waiver clause of its arbitration agreement. The district court denied Epic's motion and held that the waiver was unenforceable because it violated the right of employees to engage in ""concerted activities"" under Section Seven of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the lower court's decision and added that the waiver was also unenforceable under the savings clause of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). That clause provides that arbitration agreements are to be enforced unless there legal or equitable grounds that would render a contract unenforceable. Finding the waiver of collective proceedings illegal under the NLRA, the appellate court held that the arbitration agreement was unenforceable under the FAA. This case was consolidated with Ernst & Young v. Morris and National Labor Relations Board v. Murphy Oil USA, Inc., both cases that dealt with the relationship between the FAA and the NLRA.

Question
Does the National Labor Relations Act prohibit enforcement of an agreement requiring employees to resolve disputes with the employer through individual arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act?

Conclusion
The Court held that neither the Arbitration Act's saving clause nor the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) supersede Congress's instructions in the Federal Arbitration Act that arbitration agreements providing for individualized proceedings must be enforced. Justice Neil Gorsuch delivered the opinion for a 5-4 majority. The majority found that the Federal Arbitration Act ""instructed federal courts to enforce arbitration agreements according to their terms"" and that the NLRA ""does not mention class or collection action procedures"" and thus cannot be read to displace the Arbitration Act.

Justice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion to add that ""the employees also cannot prevail under the plain meaning of the Federal Arbitration Act.""

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan joined. The dissent noted the extreme imbalance between employer and employee and Congress's attempt to remedy that imbalance in passing the NLRA and its forerunner, the Norris-LaGuardia Act. In this context, the dissent found that the Federal Arbitration Act should not shrink the NLRA's ""protective sphere.""


## GENERATED SUMMARY (To Evaluate):
### 1. Facts of the Case
The cases before the Supreme Court were *Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis* (No. 16–285, on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, 823 F. 3d 1147), *Ernst & Young LLP et al. v. Morris et al.* (No. 16–300, on certiorari to the Ninth Circuit, 834 F. 3d 975), and *National Labor Relations Board v. Murphy Oil USA, Inc., et al.* (No. 16–307, on certiorari to the Fifth Circuit, 808 F. 3d 1013). In each, an employer (Epic Systems Corporation, Ernst & Young LLP, and Murphy Oil USA, Inc.) and employee (Jacob Lewis, Stephen Morris et al., and employees involved in the NLRB proceeding) entered into an agreement providing for individualized arbitration proceedings to resolve employment disputes. Employees nonetheless filed Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U. S. C. §216(b), and related state-law claims in federal court, seeking class or collective actions (e.g., Morris alleged misclassification of junior accountants as professionals without overtime pay). Employers moved to compel individualized arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U. S. C. §§2, 3, 4. District courts generally granted the motions, but the Seventh and Ninth Circuits reversed, holding the agreements violated the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 U. S. C. §157, by interfering with protected ""concerted activities""; the Fifth Circuit affirmed enforcement against the NLRB. The cases reached the Supreme Court to resolve a circuit split arising after the NLRB's 2012 decision in *D. R. Horton, Inc.*, 357 N. L. R. B. 2277, which held such agreements unlawful (contrary to prior NLRB General Counsel guidance in 2010 and earlier courts), with some circuits deferring under *Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.*, 467 U. S. 837.

### 2. Legal Question(s)
The Court addressed whether the FAA requires courts to enforce, as written, arbitration agreements mandating individualized proceedings for employment disputes, or whether the FAA's saving clause (9 U. S. C. §2, allowing revocation on grounds ""at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract"") excuses enforcement where such agreements allegedly violate the NLRA by interfering with employees' §7 right ""to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection,"" 29 U. S. C. §157. Employees argued the agreements were unlawful under the NLRA, rendering them revocable under the FAA saving clause; employers contended the FAA protects such agreements from interference, with no NLRA conflict.

### 3. Conclusion/Holding
The Court ruled 5-4 that Congress instructed in the FAA that arbitration agreements providing for individualized proceedings must be enforced as written, and neither the FAA saving clause nor the NLRA suggests otherwise (Gorsuch, J., for the majority, joined by Roberts, C. J., and Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito, JJ.; Thomas, J., concurring; Ginsburg, J., dissenting, joined by Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ.). The Court reversed the Seventh and Ninth Circuits (Nos. 16–285 and 16–300) and affirmed the Fifth Circuit (No. 16–307). Reasoning: (1) FAA §§2, 3, 4 establish a ""liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements"" and require ""rigorous"" enforcement of parties' chosen procedures, including individualized arbitration (*AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion*, 563 U. S. 333; *American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant*, 570 U. S. 228); (2) the saving clause applies only to ""generally applicable contract defenses, such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability,"" not those targeting arbitration's ""fundamental attributes"" like bilaterality (*Concepcion*, 563 U. S. at 339, 344), as employees' NLRA challenge does by objecting solely to individualized proceedings; (3) the NLRA does not override the FAA, as there is no ""clear and manifest"" congressional intent to displace it (*Morton v. Mancari*, 417 U. S. 535, 551; *United States v. Fausto*, 484 U. S. 439, 452–453)—§7 focuses on union organization and collective bargaining, not class/collective procedures (unknown in 1935), per text (*ejusdem generis*), structure (no rules for class certification, opt-out, etc.), and context (FLSA permits but does not mandate collective actions over arbitration, *Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp.*, 500 U. S. 20, 32); Congress knows how to override the FAA expressly (e.g., 15 U. S. C. §1226(a)(2)); no Chevron deference due, as NLRB interprets FAA (not its statute) amid Executive disagreement. Precedent set: Employer-employee arbitration agreements requiring individualized proceedings are enforceable under the FAA; NLRA §7 protects workplace concerted activities akin to unionization/collective bargaining but not a right to class or collective actions in court or arbitration, harmonizing the statutes without implied repeal.
