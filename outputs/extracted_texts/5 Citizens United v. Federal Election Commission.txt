No. 08–205. Argued March 24, 2009—Reargued September 9, 2009–– 
Decided January 21, 2010 
As amended by § 203 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 
(BCRA), federal law prohibits corporations and unions from using their 
general treasury funds to make independent expenditures for speech 
that is an “electioneering communication” or for speech that expressly 
advocates the election or defeat of a candidate. 2 U. S. C. § 441b. An 
electioneering communication is “any broadcast, cable, or satellite com­
munication” that “refers to a clearly identiﬁed candidate for Federal 
ofﬁce” and is made within 30 days of a primary election, § 434(f)(3)(A), 
and that is “publicly distributed,” 11 CFR § 100.29(a)(2), which in “the 
case of a candidate for nomination for President . . . means” that 
the communication “[c]an be received by 50,000 or more persons in a 
State where a primary election . . . is being held within 30 days,” 
§ 100.29(b)(3)(ii). Corporations and unions may establish a political ac­
tion committee (PAC) for express advocacy or electioneering communi­
cations purposes. 2 U. S. C. § 441b(b)(2). In 
McConnell 
v. 
Federal 
Election Comm’n, 
540 U. S. 93, 203–209, this Court upheld limits on 
electioneering communications in a facial challenge, relying on the 
holding in 
Austin 
v. 
Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 
494 U. S. 652, 
that political speech may be banned based on the speaker’s corporate 
identity. 
In January 2008, appellant Citizens United, a nonproﬁt corporation, 
released a documentary (hereinafter 
Hillary
) critical of then-Senator 
Hillary Clinton, a candidate for her party’s Presidential nomination. 
Anticipating that it would make 
Hillary 
available on cable television 
through video-on-demand within 30 days of primary elections, Citizens 
United produced television ads to run on broadcast and cable television. 
Concerned about possible civil and criminal penalties for violating 
§ 441b, it sought declaratory and injunctive relief, arguing that (1) § 441b 
is unconstitutional as applied to 
Hillary; 
and (2) BCRA’s disclaimer, 
disclosure, and reporting requirements, BCRA §§ 201 and 311, were un­
constitutional as applied to 
Hillary 
and the ads. The District Court 
denied Citizens United a preliminary injunction and granted appellee 
Federal Election Commission (FEC) summary judgment.

Held: 
1. 
Because the question whether § 441b applies to 
Hillary 
cannot be 
resolved on other, narrower grounds without c
hilling pol
itical speech, 
this Court must consider the continuing effect of the speech suppression 
upheld in 
Austin. 
Pp. 322–336. 
(a) 
Citizens United’s narrower arguments—that 
Hillary 
is not an 
“electioneering communication” covered by § 441b because it is not “pub­
licly distributed” under 11 CFR § 100.29(a)(2); that § 441b may not be 
applied to 
Hillary 
under 
Federal Election Comm’n 
v. 
Wisconsin Right 
to Life, Inc., 
551 U. S. 449 
(WRTL), 
which found § 441b unconstitutional 
as applied to speech that was not “express advocacy or its functional 
equivalent,” 
id., 
at 481 (opinion of R
oberts,
 
C. J.), determining that a 
communication “is the functional equivalent of express advocacy only if 
[it] is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal 
to vote for or against a speciﬁc candidate,” 
id., 
at 469–470; that § 441b 
should be invalidated as applied to movies shown through video-on­
demand because this delivery system has a lower risk of distorting the 
political process than do television ads; and that there should be an 
exception to § 441b’s ban for nonproﬁt corporate political speech funded 
overwhelmingly by individuals—are not sustainable under a fair reading 
of the statute. Pp. 322–329. 
(b) 
Thus, this case cannot be resolved on a narrower ground with­
out chilling pol
itical speech, speech that is central to the First Amend­
ment’s meaning and purpose. Citizens United did not waive this chal­
lenge to 
Austin 
when it stipulated to dismissing the facial challenge 
below, since (1) even if such a challenge could be waived, this Court may 
reconsider 
Austin 
and § 441b’s facial validity here because the District 
Court “passed upon” the issue, 
Lebron 
v. 
National Railroad Passenger 
Corporation, 
513 U. S. 374, 379; (2) throughout the litigation, Citizens 
United has asserted a claim that the FEC has violated its right to free 
speech; and (3) the parties cannot enter into a stipulation that prevents 
the Court from considering remedies necessary to resolve a claim that 
has been preserved. Because Citizens United’s narrower arguments 
are not sustainable, this Court must, in an exercise of its judicial respon­
sibility, consider § 441b’s facial validity. Any other course would pro­
long the substantial, nationwide c
hilling 
effect caused by § 441b’s corpo­
rate expenditure ban. This conclusion is further supported by the 
following: (1) the uncertainty caused by the Government’s litigating po­
sition; (2) substantial time would be required to clarify § 441b’s applica­
tion on the points raised by the Government’s position in order to avoid 
any chilling 
effect caused by an improper interpretation; and (3) because 
speech itself is of primary importance to the integrity of the election 
process, any speech arguably within the reach of rules created for regu­

312 CITIZENS UNITED

Syllabus 
lating political speech is chilled. The regulatory scheme at issue may 
not be a prior restraint in the strict sense. However, given its complex­
ity and the deference courts show to administrative determinations, 
a speaker wishing to avoid criminal liability threats and the heavy 
costs of defending against FEC enforcement must ask a governmental 
agency for prior permission to speak. The restrictions thus function as 
the equivalent of a prior restraint, giving the FEC power analogous 
to the type of government practices that the First Amendment was 
drawn to prohibit. The ongoing c
hill on 
speech makes it necessary to 
invoke the earlier precedents that a statute that c
hills 
speech can and 
must be invalidated where its facial invalidity has been demonstrated. 
Pp. 329–336. 
2. 
Austin 
is overruled, and thus provides no basis for allowing the 
Government to limit corporate independent expenditures. Hence, 
§ 441b’s restrictions on such expenditures are invalid and cannot be ap­
plied to 
Hillary. 
Given this conclusion, the part of 
McConnell 
that 
upheld BCRA § 203’s extension of § 441b’s restrictions on independent 
corporate expenditures is also overruled. Pp. 336–366. 
(a) 
Although the First Amendment provides that “Congress shall 
make no la
w...a b r i d g i n g t h e 
freedom of speech,” § 441b’s prohibition 
on corporate independent expenditures is an outright ban on speech, 
backed by criminal sanctions. It is a ban notwithstanding the fact that 
a PAC created by a corporation can still speak, for a PAC is a separate 
association from the corporation. Because speech is an essential mech­
anism of democracy—it is the means to hold ofﬁcials accountable to the 
people—political speech must prevail against laws that would suppress 
it by design or inadvertence. Laws burdening such speech are subject 
to strict scrutiny, which requires the Government to prove that the re­
striction “furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to 
achieve that interest.” 
WRTL, supra
, at 464. This language provides 
a sufﬁcient framework for protecting the interests in this case. Pre­
mised on mistrust of governmental power, the First Amendment stands 
against attempts to disfavor certain subjects or viewpoints or to distin­
guish among different speakers, which may be a means to control con­
tent. The Government may also commit a constitutional wrong when 
by law it identiﬁes certain preferred speakers. There is no basis for 
the proposition that, in the political speech context, the Government 
may impose restrictions on certain disfavored speakers. Both history 
and logic lead to this conclusion. Pp. 336–341. 
(b) 
The Court has recognized that the First Amendment applies to 
corporations, 
e. g., First Nat. Bank of Boston 
v. 
Bellotti, 
435 U. S. 765, 
778, n. 14, and extended this protection to the context of political speech, 
see, 
e. g., NAACP 
v. 
Button, 
371 U. S. 415, 428–429. Addressing chal­
lenges to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, the Court in

ley 
v. 
Valeo
, 424 U. S. 1 
(per curiam)
, upheld limits on direct contribu­
tions to candidates, 18 U. S. C. § 608(b), recognizing a governmental in­
terest in preventing 
quid pro quo 
corruption. 424 U. S., at 25–26. 
However, the Court invalidated § 608(e)’s expenditure ban, which applied 
to individuals, corporations, and unions, because it “fail[ed] to serve any 
substantial governmental interest in stemming the reality or appear­
ance of corruption in the electoral process,” 
id., 
at 47–48. While 
Buck­
ley 
did not consider a separate ban on corporate and union independent 
expenditures found in § 610, had that provision been challenged in 
Buck­
ley
’s wake, it could not have been squared with the precedent’s reason­
ing and analysis. The 
Buckley 
Court did not invoke the overbreadth 
doctrine to suggest that § 608(e)’s expenditure ban would have been con­
stitutional had it applied to corporations and unions but not individuals. 
Notwithstanding this precedent, Congress soon recodiﬁed § 610’s corpo­
rate and union expenditure ban at 2 U. S. C. § 441b, the provision at 
issue. Less than two years after 
Buckley, Bellotti 
reafﬁrmed the First 
Amendment principle that the Government lacks the power to restrict 
political speech based on the speaker’s corporate identity. 435 U. S., at 
784–785. Thus the law stood until 
Austin 
upheld a corporate independ­
ent expenditure restriction, bypassing 
Buckley 
and 
Bellotti 
by recog­
nizing a new governmental interest in preventing “the corrosive and 
distorting effects of immense aggregations of [corporate] wealth . . . that 
have little or no correlation to the public’s support for the corporation’s 
political ideas.” 494 U. S., at 660. Pp. 342–348. 
(c) 
This Court is confronted with conﬂicting lines of precedent: a 
pre-
Austin 
line forbidding speech restrictions based on the speaker’s 
corporate identity and a post-
Austin 
line permitting them. Neither 
Austin
’s antidistortion rationale nor the Government’s other justiﬁca­
tions support § 441b’s restrictions. Pp. 348–362. 
(1) 
The First Amendment prohibits Congress from ﬁning or jail­
ing citizens, or associations of citizens, for engaging in political speech, 
but 
Austin
’s antidistortion rationale would permit the Government to 
ban political speech because the speaker is an association with a corpo­
rate form. Political speech is “indispensable to decisionmaking in a de­
mocracy, and this is no less true because the speech comes from a corpo­
ration.” 
Bellotti, supra, 
at 777 (footnote omitted). This protection is 
inconsistent with 
Austin
’s rationale, which is meant to prevent corpora­
tions from obtaining “ ‘an unfair advantage in the political marketplace’ ” 
by using “ ‘resources amassed in the economic marketplace.’ ” 494 U. S., 
at 659. First Amendment protections do not depend on the speaker’s 
“ﬁnancial ability to engage in public discussion.” 
Buckley, supra, 
at 49. 
These conclusions were reafﬁrmed when the Court invalidated a BCRA 
provision that increased the cap on contributions to one candidate if 
the opponent made certain expenditures from personal funds. 
Davis 
v. 

314 CITIZENS UNITED 
v. 
FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N 
Syllabus 
Federal Election Comm’n, 
554 U. S. 724, 742. Distinguishing wealthy 
individuals from corporations based on the latter’s special advantages 
of, 
e. g., 
limited liability, does not sufﬁce to allow laws prohibiting speech. 
It is irrelevant for First Amendment purposes that corporate funds may 
“have little or no correlation to the public’s support for the corporation’s 
political ideas.” 
Austin, supra, 
at 660. All speakers, including indi­
viduals and the media, use money amassed from the economic market­
place to fund their speech, and the First Amendment protects the result­
ing speech. Under the antidistortion rationale, Congress could also ban 
political speech of media corporations. Although currently exempt 
from § 441b, they accumulate wealth with the help of their corporate 
form, may have aggregations of wealth, and may express views “hav­
[ing] little or no correlation to the public’s support” for those views. 
Differential treatment of media corporations and other corporations can­
not be squared with the First Amendment, and there is no support for 
the view that the Amendment’s original meaning would permit sup­
pressing media corporations’ political speech. 
Austin 
interferes with 
the “open marketplace” of ideas protected by the First Amendment. 
New York State Bd. of Elections 
v. 
Lopez Torres, 
552 U. S. 196, 208. 
Its censorship is vast in its reach, suppressing the speech of both for-
proﬁt and nonproﬁt, both small and large, corporations. Pp. 349–356. 
(2) 
This reasoning also shows the invalidity of the Government’s 
other arguments. It reasons that corporate political speech can be 
banned to prevent corruption or its appearance. The 
Buckley 
Court 
found this rationale “sufﬁciently important” to allow contribution limits 
but refused to extend that reasoning to expenditure limits, 424 U. S., at 
25, and the Court does not do so here. 
While a single 
Bellotti 
footnote 
purported to leave the question open, 435 U. S., at 788, n. 26, this Court 
now concludes that independent expenditures, including those made by 
corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corrup­
tion. That speakers may have inﬂuence over or access to elected ofﬁ­
cials does not mean that those ofﬁcials are corrupt. And the appear­
ance of inﬂuence or access 
will not 
cause the electorate to lose faith 
in this democracy.

A. T. Massey Coal Co.,

(3) 
The Government’s asserted interest in protecting sharehold­
ers from being compelled to fund corporate speech, like the antidistor­
tion rationale, would allow the Government to ban political speech even 
of media corporations. The statute is underinclusive; it only protects a 
dissenting shareholder’s interests in certain media for 30 or 60 days 
before an election when such interests would be implicated in any media 
at any time. It is also overinclusive because it covers all corporations, 
including those with one shareholder. Pp. 361–362.

(4) 
Because § 441b is not limited to corporations or associations 
created in foreign countries or funded predominantly by foreign share­
holders, it would be overbroad even if the Court were to recognize a 
compelling governmental interest in limiting foreign inﬂuence over the 
Nation’s political process. P. 362. 
(d) 
The relevant factors in deciding whether to adhere to 
stare deci­
sis, 
beyond workability—the precedent’s antiquity, the reliance interests 
at stake, and whether the decision was well reasoned—counsel in favor 
of abandoning 
Austin, 
which itself contravened the precedents of 
Buck­
ley 
and 
Bellotti. 
As already explained, 
Austin 
was not well reasoned. 
It is also undermined by experience since its announcement. Political 
speech is so ingrained in this country’s culture that speakers ﬁnd ways 
around campaign ﬁnance laws. Rapid changes in technology—and the 
creative dynamic inherent in the concept of free expression—counsel 
against upholding a law that restricts political speech in certain media 
or by certain speakers. In addition, no serious reliance issues are at 
stake. Thus, due consideration leads to the conclusion that 
Austin 
should be overruled. The Court returns to the principle established in 
Buckley 
and 
Bellotti 
that the Government may not suppress political 
speech based on the speaker’s corporate identity. No sufﬁcient govern­
mental interest justiﬁes limits on the political speech of nonproﬁt or 
for-proﬁt corporations. Pp. 362–366. 
3. 
BCRA §§ 201 and 311 are valid as applied to the ads for 
Hillary 
and to the movie itself. Pp. 366–372. 
(a) 
Disclaimer and disclosure requirements may burden the ability 
to speak, but they “impose no ceiling on campaign-related activities,” 
Buckley, supra
, at 64, or “ ‘ “prevent anyone from speaking,” ’ ” 
McCon­
nell, 
540 U. S., at 201. The 
Buckley 
Court explained that disclosure can 
be justiﬁed by a governmental interest in providing “the electorate with 
information” about election-related spending sources. 424 U. S., at 66. 
The 
McConnell 
Court applied this interest in rejecting facial challenges 
to §§ 201 and 311. 540 U. S., at 196. However, the Court acknowledged 
that as-applied challenges would be available if a group could show a 
“ ‘reasonable probability’ ” that disclosing its contributors’ names would 
“ ‘subject them to threats, harassment, or reprisals from either Govern­
ment ofﬁcials or private parties.’ ” 
Id., 
at 198. Pp. 366–367. 
(b) 
The disclaimer and disclosure requirements are valid as applied 
to Citizens United’s ads. They fall within BCRA’s “electioneering com­
munication” deﬁnition: They referred to then-Senator Clinton by name 
shortly before a primary and contained pejorative references to her 
candidacy. Section 311 disclaimers provide information to the elector­
ate, 
McConnell, supra, 
at 196, and “insure that the voters are fully 
informed” about who is speaking, 
Buckley, supra, 
at 76. At the very 

316 CITIZENS UNITED 
v. 
FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N 
Syllabus 
least, they avoid confusion by making clear that the ads are not funded 
by a candidate or political party. Citizens United’s arguments that 
§ 311 is underinclusive because it requires disclaimers for broadcast ad­
vertisements but not for print or Internet advertising and that § 311 
decreases the quantity and effectiveness of the group’s speech were re­
jected in 
McConnell. 
This Court also rejects their contention that 
§ 201’s disclosure requirements must be conﬁned to speech that is the 
functional equivalent of express advocacy under 
WRTL’
s test for restric­
tions on independent expenditures, 551 U. S., at 469–476 (opinion of 
R
oberts,
 
C. J.). Disclosure is the less restrictive alternative to more 
comprehensive speech regulations. Such requirements have been up­
held in 
Buckley 
and 
McConnell. 
Citizens United’s argument that no 
informational interest justiﬁes applying § 201 to its ads is similar to 
the argument this Court rejected with regard to disclaimers. Citizens 
United ﬁnally claims that disclosure requirements can c
hill 
donations by 
exposing donors to retaliation, but offers no evidence that its members 
face the type of threats, harassment, or reprisals that might make § 201 
unconstitutional as applied. Pp. 367–371. 
(c) 
For these same reasons, this Court afﬁrms the application of 
the §§ 201 and 311 disclaimer and disclosure requirements to 
Hillary.

tures for speech deﬁned as an “electioneering communi­
cation” or for speech expressly advocating the election or

eering communications were upheld in 
McConnell 
v. 
Federal 
Election Comm’n, 
540 U. S. 93, 203–209 (2003). The holding 
of 
McConnell 
rested to a large extent on an earlier case, 
Austin 
v. 
Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 
494 U. S. 652 
(1990). 
Austin 
had held that political speech may be banned 
based on the speaker’s corporate identity. 
In this case we are asked to reconsider 
Austin 
and, in 
effect, 
McConnell.

The Government may reg­
ulate corporate political speech through disclaimer and dis­
closure requirements, but it may not suppress that speech 
altogether. We turn to the case now before us.

A 
Citizens United is a nonproﬁt corporation. It brought this 
action in the United States District Court for the District of 
Columbia. A three-judge court later convened to hear the 
cause. The resulting judgment gives rise to this appeal. 
Citizens United has an annual budget of about $12 m
illion. 
Most of its funds are from donations by individuals; but, in 
addition, it accepts a small portion of its funds from for-
proﬁt corporations. 
In January 2008, Citizens United released a ﬁlm entitled 
Hillary: The Movie. 
We refer to the ﬁlm as 
Hillary. 
It is 
a 90-minute documentary about then-Senator Hillary Clin­
ton, who was a candidate in the Democratic Party’s 2008 
Presidential primary elections. 
Hillary 
mentions Senator 

320 CITIZENS UNITED 
v. 
FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N 
Opinion of the Court 
Clinton by name and depicts interviews with political com­
mentators and other persons, most of them quite critical of 
Senator Clinton. 
Hillary 
was released in theaters and on 
DVD, but Citizens United wanted to increase distribution by 
making it available through video-on-demand. 
Video-on-demand allows digital cable subscribers to select 
programming from various menus, including movies, televi­
sion shows, sports, news, and music. The viewer can watch 
the program at any time and can elect to rewind or pause 
the program. In December 2007, a cable company offered, 
for a payment of $1.2 m
illion, to 
make 
Hillary 
available 
on a video-on-demand channel called “Elections ’08.” App. 
255a–257a. Some video-on-demand services require view­
ers to pay a small fee to view a selected program, but here 
the proposal was to make 
Hillary 
available to viewers free 
of charge. 
To implement the proposal, Citizens United was prepared 
to pay for the video-on-demand; and to promote the ﬁlm, it 
produced two 10-second ads and one 30-second ad for 
Hil­
lary. 
Each ad includes a short (and, in our view, pejorative) 
statement about Senator Clinton, followed by the name of 
the movie and the movie’s Web site address. 
Id., 
at 26a–27a. 
Citizens United desired to promote the video-on-demand of­
fering by running advertisements on broadcast and cable 
television.

Before the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 
(BCRA), federal law prohibited—and still does prohibit— 
corporations and unions from using general treasury funds 
to make direct contributions to candidates or independent 
expenditures that expressly advocate the election or defeat 
of a candidate, through any form of media, in connection 
with certain qualiﬁed federal elections. 2 U. S. C. § 441b 
(2000 ed.); see 
McConnell, supra,

Opinion of the Court 
§ 441b to prohibit any “electioneering communication” as 
well. 2 U. S. C. § 441b(b)(2) (2006 ed.). An electioneering 
communication is deﬁned as “any broadcast, cable, or satel­
lite communication” that “refers to a clearly identiﬁed candi­
date for Federal ofﬁce” and is made within 30 days of a pri­
mary or 60 days of a general election. § 434(f)(3)(A). The 
Federal Election Commission’s (FEC) regulations further 
deﬁne an electioneering communication as a communication 
that is “publicly distributed.” 11 CFR § 100.29(a)(2) (2009). 
“In the case of a candidate for nomination for Presiden
t... 
publicly distributed 
means” that the communication “[c]an 
be received by 50,000 or more persons in a State where 
a primary election . . . is being held within 30 days.” 
§ 100.29(b)(3)(ii)(A). Corporations and unions are barred 
from using their general treasury funds for express advocacy 
or electioneering communications. They may establish, how­
ever, a “separate segregated fund” (known as a political 
action committee, or PAC) for these purposes. 2 U. S. C. 
§ 441b(b)(2). The moneys received by the segregated fund 
are limited to donations from stockholders and employees of 
the corporation or, in the case of unions, members of the 
union.

Citizens United wanted to make 
Hillary 
available through 
video-on-demand within 30 days of the 2008 primary elec­
tions. It feared, however, that both the ﬁlm and the ads 
would be covered by § 441b’s ban on corporate-funded in­
dependent expenditures, thus subjecting the corporation 
to civil and criminal penalties under § 437g. In December 
2007, Citizens United sought declaratory and injunctive re­
lief against the FEC. It argued that (1) § 441b is uncon­
stitutional as applied to 
Hillary; 
and (2) BCRA’s disclaimer 
and disclosure requirements, BCRA §§ 201 and 311, 116 Stat. 
88, 105, are unconstitutional as applied to 
Hillary 
and to the 
three ads for the movie. 

322 CITIZENS UNITED 
v. 
FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N 
Opinion of the Court 
The District Court denied Citizens United’s motion for a 
preliminary injunction, 530 F. Supp. 2d 274 (DC 2008) 
(per 
curiam), 
and then granted the FEC’s motion for summary 
judgment, App. 261a–262a. See 
id., 
at 261a (“Based on the 
reasoning of our prior opinion, we ﬁnd that the [FEC] is 
entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 
See Citizen[s] 
United v. FEC, 
530 F. Supp. 2d 274 (D. D. C. 2008) (denying 
Citizens United’s request for a preliminary injunction)”). 
The court held that § 441b was facially constitutional under 
McConnell, 
and that § 441b was constitutional as applied to 
Hillary 
because it was “susceptible of no other interpreta­
tion than to inform the electorate that Senator Clinton is 
unﬁt for ofﬁce, that the United States would be a dangerous 
place in a President Hillary Clinton world, and that viewers 
should vote against her.” 530 F. Supp. 2d, at 279. The 
court also rejected Citizens United’s challenge to BCRA’s 
disclaimer and disclosure requirements. It noted that “the 
Supreme Court has written approvingly of disclosure provi­
sions triggered by political speech even though the speech 
itself was constitutionally protected under the First Amend­
ment.” 
Id., 
at 281. 
We noted probable jurisdiction. 555 U. S. 1028 (2008). 
The case was reargued in this Court after the Court asked 
the parties to ﬁle supplemental briefs addressing whether 
we should overrule either or both 
Austin 
and the part of 
McConnell 
which addresses the facial validity of 2 U. S. C. 
§ 441b. See 557 U. S. 932 (2009). 
II 
Before considering whether 
Austin 
should be overruled, 
we ﬁrst address whether Citizens United’s claim that § 441b 
cannot be applied to 
Hillary 
may be resolved on other, nar­
rower grounds. 
A 
Citizens United contends that § 441b does not cover 
Hil­
lary, 
as a matter of statutory interpretation, because the ﬁlm 

Cite as: 558 U. S. 310 (2010) 
323 
Opinion of the Court 
does not qualify as an “electioneering communication.” 
§ 441b(b)(2). Citizens United raises this issue for the ﬁrst 
time before us, but we consider the issue because “it was 
addressed by the court below.” 
Lebron 
v. 
National Rail­
road Passenger Corporation, 
513 U. S. 374, 379 (1995); see 
530 F. Supp. 2d, at 277, n. 6. Under the deﬁnition of elec­
tioneering communication, the video-on-demand showing of 
Hillary 
on cable television would have been a “cable . . . 
communication” that “refer[red] to a clearly identiﬁed candi­
date for Federal ofﬁce” and that was made within 30 days 
of a primary election. 2 U. S. C. § 434(f)(3)(A)(i). Citizens 
United, however, argues that 
Hillary 
was not “publicly 
distributed,” because a single video-on-demand transmission 
is sent only to a requesting cable converter box and each 
separate transmission, in most instances, will be seen by 
just one household—not 50,000 or more persons. 11 CFR 
§ 100.29(a)(2); see § 100.29(b)(3)(ii). 
This argument ignores the regulation’s instruction on how 
to determine whether a cable transmission “[c]an be received 
by 50,000 or more persons.” § 100.29(b)(3)(ii). The regu­
lation provides that the number of people who can receive 
a cable transmission is determined by the number of cable 
subscribers in the relevant area. §§ 100.29(b)(7)(i)(G), (ii). 
Here, Citizens United wanted to use a cable video-on­
demand system that had 34.5 m
illion 
subscribers nationwide. 
App. 256a. Thus, 
Hillary 
could have been received by 
50,000 persons or more. 
One 
amici 
brief asks us, alternatively, to construe the con­
dition that the communication “[c]an be received by 50,000 
or more persons,” § 100.29(b)(3)(ii)(A), to require “a plausible 
likelihood that the communication will be viewed by 50,000 
or more potential voters”—as opposed to requiring only that 
the communication is “technologically capable” of being seen 
by that many people, Brief for Former Ofﬁcials of the Ameri­
can Civil Liberties Union 5. Whether the population and 
demographic statistics in a proposed viewing area consisted 

324 CITIZENS UNITED 
v. 
FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N 
Opinion of the Court 
of 50,000 registered voters—but not “infants, pre-teens, or 
otherwise electorally ineligible recipients”—would be a re­
quired determination, subject to judicial challenge and re­
view, in any case where the issue was in doubt. 
Id., 
at 6. 
In our view the statute cannot be saved by limiting the 
reach of 2 U. S. C. § 441b through this suggested interpreta­
tion. In addition to the costs and burdens of litigation, this 
result would require a calculation as to the number of people 
a particular communication is likely to reach, with an inaccu­
rate estimate potentially subjecting the speaker to criminal 
sanctions. The First Amendment does not permit laws that 
force speakers to retain a campaign ﬁnance attorney, con­
duct demographic marketing research, or seek declaratory 
rulings before discussing the most salient political issues of 
our day. Prolix laws chill speech for the same reason that 
vague laws chill speech: People “of common intelligence must 
necessarily guess at [the law’s] meaning and differ as to its 
application.” 
Connally 
v. 
General Constr. Co., 
269 U. S. 385, 
391 (1926). The Government may not render a ban on politi­
cal speech constitutional by carving out a limited exemption 
through an amorphous regulatory interpretation. We must 
reject the approach suggested by the 
amici. 
Section 441b 
covers 
Hillary. 
B 
Citizens United next argues that § 441b may not be applied 
to 
Hillary 
under the approach taken in 
WRTL. McConnell 
decided that § 441b(b)(2)’s deﬁnition of an “electioneering 
communication” was facially constitutional insofar as it re­
stricted speech that was “the functional equivalent of ex­
press advocacy” for or against a speciﬁc candidate. 540 
U. 
S., at 206. 
WRTL 
then found an unconstitutional applica­
tion of § 441b where the speech was not “express advocacy 
or its functional equivalent.” 551 U. S., at 481 (opinion of 
Roberts,
 
C. J.). As explained by 
The
 
Chief
 
Justice
’s 
contro
lling opinion in 
WRTL, 
the functional-equivalent test 
is objective: “[A] court should ﬁnd that [a communication] is 

Cite as: 558 U. S. 310 (2010) 
325 
Opinion of the Court 
the functional equivalent of express advocacy only if [it] is 
susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an 
appeal to vote for or against a speciﬁc candidate.” 
Id., 
at 
469–470. 
Under this test, 
Hillary 
is equivalent to express advocacy. 
The movie, in essence, is a feature-length negative advertise­
ment that urges viewers to vote against Senator Clinton for 
President. In light of historical footage, interviews with 
persons critical of her, and voiceover narration, the ﬁlm 
would be understood by most viewers as an extended criti­
cism of Senator Clinton’s character and her ﬁtness for the 
ofﬁce of the Presidency. The narrative may contain more 
suggestions and arguments than facts, but there is little 
doubt that the thesis of the ﬁlm is that she is unﬁt for the 
Presidency. The movie concentrates on alleged wrongdoing 
during the Clinton administration, Senator Clinton’s qualiﬁ­
cations and ﬁtness for ofﬁce, and policies the commentators 
predict she would pursue if elected President. It calls Sena­
tor Clinton “Machiavellian,” App. 64a, and asks whether she 
is “the most qualiﬁed to hit the ground running if elected 
President,” 
id., 
at 88a. The narrator reminds viewers that 
“Americans have never been keen on dynasties” and that 
“a vote for Hillary is a vote to continue 20 years of a Bush 
or a Clinton in the White House,” 
id., 
at 143a–144a. 
Citizens United argues that 
Hillary 
is just “a documen­
tary ﬁlm that examines certain historical events.” Brief for 
Appellant 35. We disagree. The movie’s consistent empha­
sis is on the relevance of these events to Senator Clinton’s 
candidacy for President. The narrator begins by asking 
“could [Senator Clinton] become the ﬁrst female President 
in the history of the United States?” App. 35a. And the 
narrator reiterates the movie’s message in his closing line: 
“Finally, before America decides on our next president, vot­
ers should need no reminders of . . . what’s at stake—the 
well being and prosperity of our nation.” 
Id., 
at 144a–145a. 

326 CITIZENS UNITED 
v. 
FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N 
Opinion of the Court 
As the District Court found, there is no reasonable inter­
pretation of 
Hillary 
other than as an appeal to vote against 
Senator Clinton. Under the standard stated in 
McConnell 
and further elaborated in 
WRTL, 
the ﬁlm qualiﬁes as the 
functional equivalent of express advocacy. 
C 
Citizens United further contends that § 441b should be in­
validated as applied to movies shown through video-on­
demand, arguing that this delivery system has a lower risk 
of distorting the political process than do television ads. 
Cf. 
McConnell, supra, 
at 207. On what we might call con­
ventional television, advertising spots reach viewers who 
have chosen a channel or a program for reasons unrelated 
to the advertising. With video-on-demand, by contrast, the 
viewer selects a program after taking “a series of afﬁrmative 
steps”: subscribing to cable; navigating through various 
menus; and selecting the program. See 
Reno 
v. 
American 
Civil Liberties Union, 
521 U. S. 844, 867 (1997). 
While some means of communication may be less effective 
than others at inﬂuencing the public in different contexts, 
any effort by the Judiciary to decide which means of com­
munications are to be preferred for the particular type of 
message and speaker would raise questions as to the courts’ 
own lawful authority. Substantial questions would arise if 
courts were to begin saying what means of speech should be 
preferred or disfavored. And in all events, those differenti­
ations might soon prove to be irrelevant or outdated by tech­
nologies that are in rapid ﬂux. See 
Turner Broadcasting 
System, Inc. 
v. 
FCC, 
512 U. S. 622, 639 (1994). 
Courts, too, are bound by the First Amendment. We 
must decline to draw, and then redraw, constitutional lines 
based on the particular media or technology used to dissemi­
nate political speech from a particular speaker. It must be 
noted, moreover, that this undertaking would require sub­
stantial litigation over an extended time, all to interpret a 

Cite as: 558 U. S. 310 (2010) 
327 
Opinion of the Court 
law that beyond doubt discloses serious First Amendment 
ﬂaws. The interpretive process itself would create an inevi­
table, pervasive, and serious risk of ch
illing 
protected speech 
pending the drawing of ﬁne distinctions that, in the end, 
would themselves be questionable. First Amendment 
standards, however, “must give the beneﬁt of any doubt to 
protecting rather than st
iﬂing 
speech.” 
WRTL, 
551 U. S., at 
469 (opinion of 
Roberts,
 
C. J.) (citing 
New York Times Co. 
v. 
Sullivan, 
376 U. S. 254, 269–270 (1964)). 
D 
Citizens United also asks us to carve out an exception to 
§ 441b’s expenditure ban for nonproﬁt corporate political 
speech funded overwhelmingly by individuals. As an alter­
native to reconsidering 
Austin, 
the Government also seems 
to prefer this approach. This line of analysis, however, 
would be unava
iling. 
In 
MCFL, 
the Court found unconstitutional § 441b’s re­
strictions on corporate expenditures as applied to nonproﬁt 
corporations that were formed for the sole purpose of pro­
moting political ideas, did not engage in business activities, 
and did not accept contributions from for-proﬁt corporations 
or labor unions. 479 U. S., at 263–264; see also 11 CFR 
§ 114.10. BCRA’s so-called Wellstone Amendment applied 
§ 441b’s expenditure ban to all nonproﬁt corporations. See 
2 U. S. C. § 441b(c)(6); 
McConnell, 
540 U. S., at 209. 
McCon­
nell 
then interpreted the Wellstone Amendment to retain 
the 
MCFL 
exemption to § 441b’s expenditure prohibition. 
540 U. S., at 211. Citizens United does not qualify for the 
MCFL 
exemption, however, since some funds used to make 
the movie were donations from for-proﬁt corporations. 
The Government suggests we could ﬁnd BCRA’s Wellstone 
Amendment unconstitutional, sever it from the statute, and 
hold that Citizens United’s speech is exempt from § 441b’s 
ban under BCRA’s Snowe-Jeffords Amendment, § 441b(c)(2). 
See Tr. of Oral Arg. 37–38 (Sept. 9, 2009). The Snowe-
Jeffords Amendment operates as a backup provision that 

328 CITIZENS UNITED 
v. 
FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N 
Opinion of the Court 
only takes effect if the Wellstone Amendment is invalidated. 
See 
McConnell, supra, 
at 339 (
Kennedy,
 
J., concurring 
in judgment in part and dissenting in part). The Snowe-
Jeffords Amendment would exempt from § 441b’s expendi­
ture ban the political speech of certain nonproﬁt corporations 
if the speech were funded “exclusively” by individual donors 
and the funds were maintained in a segregated account. 
§ 441b(c)(2). Citizens United would not qualify for the 
Snowe-Jeffords exemption, under its terms as written, be­
cause 
Hillary 
was funded in part with donations from for-
proﬁt corporations. 
Consequently, to hold for Citizens United on this argu­
ment, the Court would be required to revise the text of 
MCFL, 
sever BCRA’s Wellstone Amendment, § 441b(c)(6), 
and ignore the plain text of BCRA’s Snowe-Jeffords Amend­
ment, § 441b(c)(2). If the Court decided to create a 
de mini-
mis 
exception to 
MCFL 
or the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment, 
the result would be to allow for-proﬁt corporate general 
treasury funds to be spent for independent expenditures that 
support candidates. There is no principled basis for doing 
this without rewriting 
Austin
’s holding that the Government 
can restrict corporate independent expenditures for politi­
cal speech. 
Though it is true that the Court should construe statutes 
as necessary to avoid constitutional questions, the series of 
steps suggested would be difﬁcult to take in view of the lan­
guage of the statute. In addition to those difﬁculties the 
Government’s suggestion is troubling for still another rea­
son. The Government does not say that it agrees with the 
interpretation it wants us to consider. See Supp. Brief for 
Appellee 3, n. 1 (“Some courts” have implied a 
de minimis 
exception, and “appellant would appear to be covered by 
these decisions”). Presumably it would ﬁnd textual difﬁ­
culties in this approach too. The Government, like any 
party, can make arguments in the alternative; but it ought 
to say if there is merit to an alternative proposal instead of 

Cite as: 558 U. S. 310 (2010) 
329 
Opinion of the Court 
merely suggesting it. This is especially true in the context 
of the First Amendment. As the Government stated, this 
case “would require a remand” to apply a 
de minimis 
stand­
ard. Tr. of Oral Arg. 39 (Sept. 9, 2009). Applying this 
standard would thus require case-by-case determinations. 
But archetypical political speech would be chilled in the 
meantime. “ ‘First Amendment freedoms need breathing 
space to survive.’ ” 
WRTL, supra
, at 468–469 (opinion of 
Roberts,
 
C. J.) (quoting 
NAACP 
v. 
Button, 
371 U. S. 415, 
433 (1963)). We decline to adopt an interpretation that 
requires intricate case-by-case determinations to verify 
whether political speech is banned, especially if we are con­
vinced that, in the end, this corporation has a constitutional 
right to speak on this subject. 
E 
As the foregoing analysis conﬁrms, the Court cannot re­
solve this case on a narrower ground without ch
illing pol
iti­
cal speech, speech that is central to the meaning and purpose 
of the First Amendment. See 
Morse 
v. 
Frederick, 
551 U. S. 
393, 403 (2007). It is not judicial restraint to accept an un­
sound, narrow argument just so the Court can avoid another 
argument with broader implications. Indeed, a court would 
be remiss in performing its duties were it to accept an un­
sound principle merely to avoid the necessity of making a 
broader ruling. Here, the lack of a valid basis for an alter­
native ruling requires full consideration of the continuing ef­
fect of the speech suppression upheld in 
Austin. 
Citizens United stipulated to dismissing count 5 of its com­
plaint, which raised a facial challenge to § 441b, even though 
count 3 raised an as-applied challenge. See App. 23a (count 
3: 
“As applied to 
Hillary, 
[§ 441b] is unconstitutional under 
the First Amendment guarantees of free expression and as­
sociation”). The Government argues that Citizens United 
waived its challenge to 
Austin 
by dismissing count 5. We 
disagree. 

330 CITIZENS UNITED 
v. 
FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N 
Opinion of the Court 
First, even if a party could somehow waive a facial chal­
lenge while preserving an as-applied challenge, that would 
not prevent the Court from reconsidering 
Austin 
or address­
ing the facial validity of § 441b in this case. “Our practice 
‘permit[s] review of an issue not pressed [below] so long as 
it has been passed upon . . . .’ ”

(quoting 
United States 
v. 
Williams, 
504 U. S. 36, 41 (1992); 
ﬁrst alteration in original). And here, the District Court 
addressed Citizens United’s facial challenge. See 530 
F. 
Supp. 2d, at 278 (“Citizens wants us to enjoin the opera­
tion of BCRA § 203 as a facially unconstitutional burden on 
the First Amendment right to freedom of speech”). In re­
jecting the claim, it noted that it “would have to overrule 
McConnell
” for Citizens United to prevail on its facial chal­
lenge and that “[o]nly the Supreme Court may overrule its 
decisions.” 
Ibid. 
(citing 
Rodriguez de Quijas 
v. 
Shearson/ 
American Express, Inc., 
490 U. S. 477, 484 (1989)). The Dis­
trict Court did not provide much analysis regarding the fa­
cial challenge because it could not ignore the contro
lling Su­
preme Court decisions in 
Austin 
and 
McConnell. 
Even so, 
the District Court did “ ‘pas[s] upon’ ” the issue. 
Lebron, 
supra, 
at 379. Furthermore, the District Court’s later 
opinion, which granted the FEC summary judgment, was 
“[b]ased on the reasoning of [its] prior opinion,” which in­
cluded the discussion of the facial challenge. App. 261a (cit­
ing 530 F. Supp. 2d 274). After the District Court ad­
dressed the facial validity of the statute, Citizens United 
raised its challenge to 
Austin 
in this Court. See Brief for 
Appellant 30 (“
Austin 
was wrongly decided and should be 
overruled”); 
id., 
at 30–32. In these circumstances, it is nec­
essary to consider Citizens United’s challenge to 
Austin 
and 
the facial validity of § 441b’s expenditure ban. 
Second, throughout the litigation, Citizens United has as­
serted a claim that the FEC has violated its First Amend­
ment right to free speech. All concede that this claim is 
properly before us. And “ ‘[o]nce a federal claim is properly

Opinion of the Court 
presented, a party can make any argument in support of that 
claim; parties are not limited to the precise arguments they 
made below.’ ” 
Lebron, supra, 
at 379 (quoting 
Yee 
v. 
Escon­
dido, 
503 U. S. 519, 534 (1992); alteration in original). Citi­
zens United’s argument that 
Austin 
should be overruled is 
“not a new claim.” 
Lebron, 
513 U. S., at 379. Rather, it 
is—at most—“a new argument to support what has been [a] 
consistent claim: that [the FEC] did not accord [Citizens 
United] the rights it was obliged to provide by the First 
Amendment.” 
Ibid. 
Third, the distinction between facial and as-applied chal­
lenges is not so well deﬁned that it has some automatic effect 
or that it must always control the pleadings and disposition 
in every case involving a constitutional challenge. The dis­
tinction is both instructive and necessary, for it goes to the 
breadth of the remedy employed by the Court, not what 
must be pleaded in a complaint. See 
United States 
v. 
Treas­
ury Employees, 
513 U. S. 454, 477–478 (1995) (contrasting 
“a facial challenge” with “a narrower remedy”). The parties 
cannot enter into a stipulation that prevents the Court from 
considering certain remedies if those remedies are necessary 
to resolve a claim that has been preserved. Citizens United 
has preserved its First Amendment challenge to § 441b as 
applied to the facts of its case; and given all the circum­
stances, we cannot easily address that issue without as­
suming a premise—the permissibility of restricting corpo­
rate political speech—that is itself in doubt. See Fallon, 
As-Applied and Facial Challenges and Third-Party Standing, 
113 Harv. L. Rev. 1321, 1339 (2000) (“[O]nce a case is brought, 
no general categorical line bars a court from making broader 
pronouncements of invalidity in properly ‘as-applied’ cases”); 
id., 
at 1327–1328. As our request for supplemental brieﬁng 
implied, Citizens United’s claim implicates the validity of 
Austin, 
which in turn implicates the facial validity of § 441b. 
When the statute now at issue came before the Court in 
McConnell, 
both the majority and the dissenting opinions 

332 CITIZENS UNITED 
v. 
FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N 
Opinion of the Court 
considered the question of its facial validity. The holding 
and validity of 
Austin 
were essential to the reasoning of the 
McConnell 
majority opinion, which upheld BCRA’s exten­
sion of § 441b. See 540 U. S., at 205 (quoting 
Austin, 
494 
U.

McConnell 
permitted federal felony punish­
ment for speech by all corporations, including nonproﬁt ones, 
that speak on prohibited subjects shortly before federal elec­
tions. See 540 U. S., at 203–209. Four Members of the 
Mc­
Connell 
Court would have overruled 
Austin, 
including Chief 
Justice Rehnquist, who had joined the Court’s opinion in 
Austin 
but reconsidered that conclusion. See 540 U. S., at 
256–262 (

ment in part, and dissenting in part);

id., 
at 322–338 (opinion of

C.

of the statute was facilitated by the extensive record, which 
was “over 100,000 pages” long, made in the three-judge Dis­
trict Court.

It is not the case, then, that the Court today is premature in 
interpreting § 441b “ ‘on the basis of [a] factually barebones 
recor[d].’ ”

Washington State

Sabri 
v.

541 U. S. 600, 609 (2004)). 
The 
McConnell 
majority considered whether the statute 
was facially invalid. An as-applied challenge was brought 
in 
Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. 
v. 
Federal Election Comm’n, 
546 U. S. 410, 411–412 (2006) 
(per curiam), 
and the Court 
conﬁrmed that the challenge could be maintained. Then, in 
WRTL, 
the contro
lling opinion of the 
Court not only enter­
tained an as-applied challenge but also sustained it. Three 
Justices noted that they would continue to maintain the posi­
tion that the record in 
McConnell 
demonstrated the invalid­
ity of the Act on its face. 551 U. S., at 485–504 (opinion of 

Cite as: 558 U. S. 310 (2010) 
333 
Opinion of the Court 
Scalia,
 
J.). The contro
lling opinion in 
WRTL, 
which re­
frained from holding the statute invalid except as applied to 
the facts then before the Court, was a careful attempt to 
accept the essential elements of the Court’s opinion in 
Mc­
Connell, 
while vindicating the First Amendment arguments 
made by the 
WRTL 
parties. 551 U. S., at 482 (opinion of 
Roberts,
 
C. J.). 
As noted above, Citizens United’s narrower arguments are 
not sustainable under a fair reading of the statute. In the 
exercise of its judicial responsibility, it is necessary then for 
the Court to consider the facial validity of § 441b. Any other 
course of decision would prolong the substantial, nationwide 
chilling 
effect caused by § 441b’s prohibitions on corporate 
expenditures. Consideration of the facial validity of § 441b 
is further supported by the following reasons. 
First is the uncertainty caused by the litigating position 
of the Government. As discussed above, see Part II–D, 
supra, 
the Government suggests, as an alternative argu­
ment, that an as-applied challenge might have merit. This 
argument proceeds on the premise that the nonproﬁt corpo­
ration involved here may have received only 
de minimis 
do­
nations from for-proﬁt corporations and that some nonproﬁt 
corporations may be exempted from the operation of the 
statute. The Government also suggests that an as-applied 
challenge to § 441b’s ban on books may be successful, al­
though it would defend § 441b’s ban as applied to almost 
every other form of media including pamphlets. See Tr. of 
Oral Arg. 65–66 (Sept. 9, 2009). The Government thus, by 
its own position, contributes to the uncertainty that § 441b 
causes. When the Government holds out the possibility of 
ruling for Citizens United on a narrow ground yet refrains 
from adopting that position, the added uncertainty demon­
strates the necessity to address the question of statutory 
validity. 
Second, substantial time would be required to bring clarity 
to the application of the statutory provision on these points 

334 CITIZENS UNITED 
v. 
FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N 
Opinion of the Court 
in order to avoid any ch
illing 
effect caused by some improper 
interpretation. See Part II–C, 
supra. 
It is well known 
that the public begins to concentrate on elections only in the 
weeks immediately before they are held. There are short 
timeframes in which speech can have inﬂuence. The need 
or relevance of the speech will often ﬁrst be apparent at this 
stage in the campaign. The decision to speak is made in the 
heat of political campaigns, when speakers react to messages 
conveyed by others. A speaker’s ability to engage in politi­
cal speech that could have a chance of persuading voters is 
stiﬂed if the speaker must ﬁrst commence a protracted law­
suit. By the time the lawsuit concludes, the election will be 
over and the litigants in most cases will have neither the 
incentive nor, perhaps, the resources to carry on, even if they 
could establish that the case is not moot because the issue is 
“capable of repetition, yet evading review.” 
WRTL, supra, 
at 462 (opinion of 
Roberts,
 
C. J.) (citing 
Los Angeles 
v. 
Lyons, 
461 U. S. 95, 109 (1983); 
Southern Paciﬁc Terminal 
Co. 
v. 
ICC, 
219 U. S. 498, 515 (1911)). Here, Citizens United 
decided to litigate its case to the end. Today, Citizens 
United ﬁnally learns, two years after the fact, whether it 
could have spoken during the 2008 Presidential primary— 
long after the opportunity to persuade primary voters has 
passed. 
Third is the primary importance of speech itself to the 
integrity of the election process. As additional rules are 
created for regulating political speech, any speech arguably 
within their reach is chilled. See Part II–A, 
supra. 
Cam­
paign ﬁnance regulations now impose “unique and complex 
rules” on “71 distinct entities.” Brief for Seven Former

568 pages of regulations, 1,278 pages of explanations and jus­
tiﬁcations for those regulations, and 1,771 advisory opinions 
since 1975. See 
id., 
at 6, n. 7. In fact, after this Court in

335 
Opinion of the Court 
WRTL 
adopted an objective “appeal to vote” test for deter­
mining whether a communication was the functional equiva­
lent of express advocacy, 551 U. S., at 470 (opinion of 
Rob­
erts,
 
C. J.), the FEC adopted a two-part, 11-factor balancing 
test to implement 
WRTL
’s ruling. See 11 CFR § 114.15; 
Brief for Wyoming Liberty Group et al. as 
Amici Curiae 
17–27 (ﬁled Jan. 15, 2009). 
This regulatory scheme may not be a prior restraint on 
speech in the strict sense of that term, for prospective speak­
ers are not compelled by law to seek an advisory opinion 
from the FEC before the speech takes place. Cf. 
Near 
v. 
Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 
283 U. S. 697, 712–713 (1931). As 
a practical matter, however, given the complexity of the reg­
ulations and the deference courts show to administrative de­
terminations, a speaker who wants to avoid threats of crimi­
nal liability and the heavy costs of defending against FEC 
enforcement must ask a governmental agency for prior per­
mission to speak. See 2 U. S. C. § 437f; 11 CFR § 112.1. 
These onerous restrictions thus function as the equivalent of 
prior restraint by giving the FEC power analogous to licens­
ing laws implemented in 16th- and 17th-century England, 
laws and governmental practices of the sort that the First 
Amendment was drawn to prohibit. See 
Thomas 
v. 
Chicago

Near, supra, 
at 713–714. Be­
cause the FEC’s “business is to censor, there inheres the 
danger that [it] may well be less responsive than a court— 
part of an independent branch of government—to the consti­
tutionally protected interests in free expression.” 
Freed­
man 
v. 
Maryland, 
380 U. S. 51, 57–58 (1965). When the 
FEC issues advisory opinions that prohibit speech, “[m]any 
persons, rather than undertake the considerable burden (and 
sometimes risk) of vindicating their rights through case-by­
case litigation, will choose simply to abstain from protected 
speech—harming not only themselves but society as a whole, 
which is deprived of an uninhibited marketplace of ideas.”

This is precisely what 
WRTL 
sought to avoid. 
WRTL 
said that First Amendment standards “must eschew ‘the 
open-ended rough-and-tumble of factors,’ which ‘invit[es] 
complex argument in a trial court and a virtually inevitable 
appeal.’ ” 551 U. S., at 469 (opinion of

ing 
Jerome B. Grubart, Inc. 
v. 
Great Lakes Dredge & Dock 
Co., 
513 U. S. 527, 547 (1995); alteration in original). Yet, 
the FEC has created a regime that allows it to select what 
political speech is safe for public consumption by applying 
ambiguous tests. If parties want to avoid litigation and the 
possibility of civil and criminal penalties, they must either 
refrain from speaking or ask the FEC to issue an advisory 
opinion approving of the political speech in question. Gov­
ernment ofﬁcials pore over each word of a text to see if, in 
their judgment, it accords with the 11-factor test they have 
promulgated. This is an unprecedented governmental in­
tervention into the realm of speech. 
The ongoing chill upon speech that is beyond all doubt pro­
tected makes it necessary in this case to invoke the earlier 
precedents that a statute which chills speech can and must 
be invalidated where its facial invalidity has been demon­
strated. See 
WRTL, supra, 
at 482–483 (
Alito,
 
J., concur­
ring);

Austin.

The First Amendment provides that “Congress shall make 
no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.” Laws enacted 
to control or suppress speech may operate at different points 
in the speech process. The following are just a few exam­
ples of restrictions that have been attempted at different 
stages of the speech process—all laws found to be invalid: 
restrictions requiring a permit at the outset,

The law before us is an outright ban, backed by criminal 
sanctions. Section 441b makes it a felony for all corpora­
tions—including nonproﬁt advocacy corporations—either to 
expressly advocate the election or defeat of candidates or to 
broadcast electioneering communications within 30 days of a 
primary election and 60 days of a general election. Thus, 
the following acts would all be felonies under § 441b: The 
Sierra Club runs an ad, within the crucial phase of 60 days 
before the general election, that exhorts the public to disap­
prove of a Congressman who favors logging in national for­
ests; the National Riﬂe Association publishes a book urging 
the public to vote for the challenger because the incumbent 
U. 
S. Senator supports a handgun ban; and the American 
Civil Liberties Union creates a Web site te
lling the 
public to 
vote for a Presidential candidate in light of that candidate’s 
defense of free speech. These prohibitions are classic exam­
ples of censorship. 
Section 441b is a ban on corporate speech notwithstanding 
the fact that a PAC created by a corporation can still speak. 
See 
McConnell, 
540 U. S., at 330–333 (opinion of 
Kennedy,
 
J.). A PAC is a separate association from the corporation. 
So the PAC exemption from § 441b’s expenditure ban, 
§ 441b(b)(2), does not allow corporations to speak. Even if a 
PAC could somehow allow a corporation to speak—and it 
does not—the option to form PACs does not alleviate the 
First Amendment problems with § 441b. PACs are bur­
densome alternatives; they are expensive to administer and 
subject to extensive regulations. For example, every PAC 

338 CITIZENS UNITED 
v. 
FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N 
Opinion of the Court 
must appoint a treasurer, forward donations to the treasurer 
promptly, keep detailed records of the identities of the per­
sons making donations, preserve receipts for three years, 
and ﬁle an organization statement and report changes to this 
information within 10 days. See 
id., 
at 330–332 (quoting 
MCFL, 
479 U. S., at 253–254 (opinion of Brennan, J.)). 
And that is just the beginning. PACs must ﬁle detailed 
monthly reports with the FEC, which are due at different 
times depending on the type of election that is about to 
occur: 
“ ‘These reports must contain information regarding the 
amount of cash on hand; the total amount of receipts, 
detailed by 10 different categories; the identiﬁcation of 
each political committee and candidate’s authorized or 
afﬁliated committee making contributions, and any per­
sons making loans, providing rebates, refunds, divi­
dends, or interest or any other offset to operating ex­
penditures in an aggregate amount over $200; the total 
amount of all disbursements, detailed by 12 different 
categories; the names of all authorized or afﬁliated com­
mittees to whom expenditures aggregating over $200 
have been made; persons to whom loan repayments or 
refunds have been made; the total sum of all contribu­
tions, operating expenses, outstanding debts and obliga­
tions, and the settlement terms of the retirement of any 
debt or obligation.’ ” 540 U. S., at 331–332 (quoting 
MCFL, supra, 
at 253–254). 
PACs have to comply with these regulations just to speak. 
This might explain why fewer than 2,000 of the m
illions 
of corporations in this country have PACs. See Brief for 
Seven Former Chairmen of FEC et al. as

PACs, furthermore, must exist before they can speak. 
Given the onerous restrictions, a corporation may not be able 
to establish a PAC in time to make its views known regard­
ing candidates and issues in a current campaign. 
Section 441b’s prohibition on corporate independent ex­
penditures is thus a ban on speech. As a “restriction on the 
amount of money a person or group can spend on political 
communication during a campaign,” that statute “necessarily 
reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number 
of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the 
size of the audience reached.” 
Buckley 
v. 
Valeo, 
424 U. S. 
1, 19 (1976) 
(per curiam). 
Were the Court to uphold these 
restrictions, the Government could repress speech by si­
lencing certain voices at any of the various points in the 
speech process. See 
McConnell, supra, 
at 251 (opinion of 
Scalia,
 
J.) (Government could repress speech by “attacking 
all levels of the production and dissemination of ideas,” for 
“effective public communication requires the speaker to 
make use of the services of others”). If § 441b applied to 
individuals, no one would believe that it is merely a time, 
place, or manner restriction on speech. Its purpose and ef­
fect are to silence entities whose voices the Government 
deems to be suspect. 
Speech is an essential mechanism of democracy, for it is 
the means to hold ofﬁcials accountable to the people. See 
Buckley, supra, 
at 14–15 (“In a republic where the people 
are sovereign, the ability of the citizenry to make informed 
choices among candidates for ofﬁce is essential”). The right 
of citizens to inquire, to hear, to speak, and to use informa­
tion to reach consensus is a precondition to enlightened self-
government and a necessary means to protect it. The First 
Amendment “ ‘has its fullest and most urgent application’ to 
speech uttered during a campaign for political ofﬁce.”

Buckley, supra, 
at 14 (“Discussion 
of public issues and debate on the qualiﬁcations of candidates 
are integral to the operation of the system of government 
established by our Constitution”). 
For these reasons, political speech must prevail against 
laws that would suppress it, whether by design or inadver­
tence. Laws that burden political speech are “subject to 
strict scrutiny,” which requires the Government to prove 
that the restriction “furthers a compe
lling i
nterest and is 
narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.” 
WRTL, 
551 
U. 
S., at 464 (opinion of 
Roberts,
 
C. J.). While it might be 
maintained that political speech simply cannot be banned or 
restricted as a categorical matter, see 
Simon & Schuster, 
502 
U. S., 
at 124 (
Kennedy,
 
J., concurring in judgment), the 
quoted language from 
WRTL 
provides a sufﬁcient frame­
work for protecting the relevant First Amendment interests 
in this case. We shall employ it here. 
Premised on mistrust of governmental power, the First 
Amendment stands against attempts to disfavor certain sub­
jects or viewpoints. See, 
e. g., United States 
v. 
Playboy En­
tertainment Group, Inc., 
529 U. S. 803, 813 (2000) (striking 
down content-based restriction). Prohibited, too, are re­
strictions distinguishing among different speakers, allowing 
speech by some but not others. See 
First Nat. Bank of Bos­
ton 
v. 
Bellotti, 
435 U. S. 765, 784 (1978). As instruments to 
censor, these categories are interrelated: Speech restrictions 
based on the identity of the speaker are all too often simply 
a means to control content. 
Quite apart from the purpose or effect of regulating con­
tent, moreover, the Government may commit a constitutional 
wrong when by law it identiﬁes certain preferred speakers. 
By taking the right to speak from some and giving it to oth­
ers, the Government deprives the disadvantaged person or 
class of the right to use speech to strive to establish worth, 

Cite as: 558 U. S. 310 (2010) 
341 
Opinion of the Court 
standing, and respect for the speaker’s voice. The Govern­
ment may not by these means deprive the public of the right 
and privilege to determine for itself what speech and speak­
ers are worthy of consideration. The First Amendment pro­
tects speech and speaker, and the ideas that ﬂow from each. 
The Court has upheld a narrow class of speech restrictions 
that operate to the disadvantage of certain persons, but 
these rulings were based on an interest in allowing govern­
mental entities to perform their functions. See, 
e. g., Bethel 
School Dist. No. 403 
v. 
Fraser,

(“[F]ederal service should depend upon meritorious per­

dependent expenditures at issue in this case, however, would 
not interfere with governmental functions, so these cases are 
inapposite. These precedents stand only for the proposition 
that there are certain governmental functions that cannot 
operate without some restrictions on particular kinds of 
speech. By contrast, it is inherent in the nature of the polit­
ical process that voters must be free to obtain information 
from diverse sources in order to determine how to cast their 
votes. At least before 
Austin, 
the Court had not allowed 
the exclusion of a class of speakers from the general public 
dialogue. 
We ﬁnd no basis for the proposition that, in the context of 
political speech, the Government may impose restrictions on 
certain disfavored speakers. Both history and logic lead us 
to this conclusion.

tected. Corporations and other associations, like individu­
als, contribute to the ‘discussion, debate, and the dissemina­
tion of information and ideas’ that the First Amendment 
seeks to foster” (quoting 
Bellotti, 
435 U. S., at 783)). The 
Court has thus rejected the argument that political speech 
of corporations or other associations should be treated differ­
ently under the First Amendment simply because such asso­
ciations are not “natural persons.” 
Id., 
at 776; see 
id., 
at 
780, n. 16. Cf. 
id., 
at 828 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). 
At least since the latter part of the 19th century, the laws 
of some States and of the United States imposed a ban on 
corporate direct contributions to candidates. See B. Smith, 
Unfree Speech: The Folly of Campaign Finance Reform 23 
(2001). Yet not until 1947 did Congress ﬁrst prohibit inde­
pendent expenditures by corporations and labor unions in 
§ 304 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, 61 Stat. 
159 (codiﬁed at 2 U. S. C. § 251 (1946 ed., Supp. I)). In pass­
ing this Act Congress overrode the veto of President Tru­
man, who warned that the expenditure ban was a “dangerous 
intrusion on free speech.” Message from the President of 
the United States, H. R. Doc. No. 334, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 
9 (1947). 
For almost three decades thereafter, the Court did not 
reach the question whether restrictions on corporate and 
union expenditures are constitutional. See 
WRTL, 
551 
U. 
S., at 502 (opinion of 
Scalia,
 
J.). The question was in 
the background of 
United States 
v. 
CIO, 
335 U. S. 106 (1948). 
There, a labor union endorsed a congressional candidate in 
its weekly periodical. The Court stated that “the gravest 
doubt would arise in our minds as to [the federal expenditure 
prohibition’s] constitutionality” if it were construed to sup­
press that writing. 
Id., 
at 121. The Court engaged in stat­
utory interpretation and found the statute did not cover the 
publication. 
Id., 
at 121–122, and n. 20. Four Justices, how­
ever, said they would reach the constitutional question and

ture ban. 
Id., 
at 155 (Rutledge, J., joined by Black, Douglas, 
and Murphy, JJ., concurring in result). The concurrence ex­
plained that any “ ‘undue inﬂuence’ ” generated by a speak­
er’s “large expenditures” was outweighed “by the loss for 
democratic processes resulting from the restrictions upon 
free and full public discussion.” 
Id., 
at 143. 
In 
United States 
v. 
Automobile Workers, 
352 U. S. 567 
(1957), the Court again encountered the independent expend­
iture ban, which had been recodiﬁed at 18 U. S. C. § 610 (1952 
ed.). See 62 Stat. 723–724. After holding only that a union 
television broadcast that endorsed candidates was covered 
by the statute, the Court “[r]efus[ed] to anticipate con­
stitutional questions” and remanded for the trial to pro­
ceed. 352 U. S., at 591. Three Justices dissented, arguing 
that the Court should have reached the constitutional ques­
tion and that the ban on independent expenditures was 
unconstitutional: 
“Under our Constitution it is We The People who are 
sovereign. The people have the ﬁnal say. The legis­
lators are their spokesmen. The people determine 
through their votes the destiny of the nation. It is 
therefore important—vitally important—that all chan­
nels of communication be open to them during every 
election, that no point of view be restrained or barred, 
and that the people have access to the views of every 
group in the community.” 
Id., 
at 593 (opinion of Doug­
las, J., joined by Warren, C. J., and Black, J.). 
The dissent concluded that deeming a particular group “too 
powerful” was not a “justiﬁcatio[n] for withholding First 
Amendment rights from any group—labor or corporate.” 
Id., 
at 597. The Court did not get another opportunity to 
consider the constitutional question in that case; for after a 
remand, a jury found the defendants not guilty. See Hay­
ward, Revisiting the Fable of Reform, 45 Harv. J. Legis. 421,

Opinion of the Court 
Later, in 
Pipeﬁtters 
v. 
United States, 
407 U. S. 385, 400– 
401 (1972), the Court reversed a conviction for expenditure 
of union funds for political speech—again without reaching 
the constitutional question. The Court would not resolve 
that question for another four years.

In 
Buckley, 
424 U. S. 1, the Court addressed various chal­
lenges to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 
(FECA) as amended in 1974. These amendments created 
18 U. S. C. § 608(e) (1970 ed., Supp. V), see 88 Stat. 1265, an 
independent expenditure ban separate from § 610 that ap­
plied to individuals as well as corporations and labor unions, 
Buckley, 
424 U. S., at 23, 39, and n. 45. 
Before addressing the constitutionality of § 608(e)’s inde­
pendent expenditure ban, 
Buckley 
ﬁrst upheld § 608(b), 
FECA’s limits on direct contributions to candidates. The 
Buckley 
Court recognized a “sufﬁciently important” govern­
mental interest in “the prevention of corruption and the ap­
pearance of corruption.” 
Id., 
at 25; see 
id., 
at 26. This fol­
lowed from the Court’s concern that large contributions 
could be given “to secure a political 
quid pro quo.
” 
Ibid. 
The 
Buckley 
Court explained that the potential for 
quid 
pro quo 
corruption distinguished direct contributions to can­
didates from independent expenditures. The Court empha­
sized that “the independent expenditure ce
ilin
g...f a i l st o 
serve any substantial governmental interest in stemming the 
reality or appearance of corruption in the electoral process,” 
id., 
at 47–48, because “[t]he absence of prearrangement and 
coordination . . . alleviates the danger that expenditures will 
be given as a 
quid pro quo 
for improper commitments from 
the candidate,” 
id., 
at 47. 
Buckley 
invalidated § 608(e)’s re­
strictions on independent expenditures, with only one Justice 
dissenting. See 
Federal Election Comm’n 
v. 
National Con­
servative Political Action Comm., 
470 U. S. 480, 491, n. 3 
(1985) 
(NCPAC). 

346 CITIZENS UNITED 
v. 
FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N 
Opinion of the Court 
Buckley 
did not consider § 610’s separate ban on corporate 
and union independent expenditures, the prohibition that 
had also been in the background in 
CIO, Automobile Work­
ers, 
and 
Pipeﬁtters. 
Had § 610 been challenged in the wake 
of 
Buckley, 
however, it could not have been squared with 
the reasoning and analysis of that precedent. See 
WRTL, 
551 U. S., at 487 (opinion of 
Scalia,
 
J.
)( “
Buckley 
might well 
have been the last word on limitations on independent ex­
penditures”); 
Austin, 
494 U. S., at 683 (
Scalia,
 
J., dissent­
ing). The expenditure ban invalidated in 
Buckley, 
§ 608(e), 
applied to corporations and unions, 424 U. S., at 23, 39, n. 45; 
and some of the preva
iling 
plaintiffs in 
Buckley 
were corpo­
rations, 
id., 
at 8. The 
Buckley 
Court did not invoke the 
First Amendment’s overbreadth doctrine, see 
Broadrick 
v. 
Oklahoma, 
413 U. S. 601, 615 (1973), to suggest that § 608(e)’s 
expenditure ban would have been constitutional if it had ap­
plied only to corporations and not to individuals, 424 U. S., 
at 50. 
Buckley 
cited with approval the 
Automobile Work­
ers 
dissent, which argued that § 610 was unconstitutional. 
424 U. S., at 43 (citing 352 U. S., at 595–596 (opinion of Doug­
las, J.)). 
Notwithstanding this precedent, Congress recodified 
§ 610’s corporate and union expenditure ban at 2 U. S. C. 
§ 441b four months after 
Buckley 
was decided. See 90 Stat. 
490. 
Section 441b is the independent expenditure restric­
tion challenged here. 
Less than two years after 
Buckley, Bellotti, 
435 U. S. 765, 
reafﬁrmed the First Amendment principle that the Govern­
ment cannot restrict political speech based on the speaker’s 
corporate identity. 
Bellotti 
could not have been clearer 
when it struck down a state-law prohibition on corporate in­
dependent expenditures related to referenda issues: 
“We thus ﬁnd no support in the First . . . Amendment, 
or in the decisions of this Court, for the proposition that 
speech that otherwise would be within the protection of 
the First Amendment loses that protection simply be­

347 
Opinion of the Court 
cause its source is a corporation that cannot prove, to 
the satisfaction of a court, a material effect on its busi­
ness or property. . . . [That proposition] amounts to an 
impermissible legislative prohibition of speech based on 
the identity of the interests that spokesmen may repre­
sent in public debate over controversial issues and a 
requirement that the speaker have a sufﬁciently great 
interest in the subject to justify communication. 
.
.
.
.
. 
“In the realm of protected speech, the legislature is 
constitutionally disqualiﬁed from dictating the subjects 
about which persons may speak and the speakers who 
may address a public issue.” 
Id., 
at 784–785. 
It is important to note that the reasoning and holding of 
Bellotti 
did not rest on the existence of a viewpoint-
discriminatory statute. It rested on the principle that the 
Government lacks the power to ban corporations from 
speaking. 
Bellotti 
did not address the constitutionality of the State’s 
ban on corporate independent expenditures to support candi­
dates. In our view, however, that restriction would have 
been unconstitutional under 
Bellotti
’s central principle: that 
the First Amendment does not allow political speech restric­
tions based on a speaker’s corporate identity. See 
ibid. 
3 
Thus the law stood until 
Austin. Austin 
“uph[eld] a di­
rect restriction on the independent expenditure of funds for 
political speech for the ﬁrst time in [this Court’s] history.” 
494 U. S., at 695 (
Kennedy,
 
J., dissenting). There, the Mich­
igan Chamber of Commerce sought to use general treasury 
funds to run a newspaper ad supporting a speciﬁc candidate. 
Michigan law, however, prohibited corporate independent ex­
penditures that supported or opposed any candidate for state 
ofﬁce. A violation of the law was punishable as a felony. 
The Court sustained the speech prohibition. 

348 CITIZENS UNITED 
v. 
FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N 
Opinion of the Court 
To bypass 
Buckley 
and 
Bellotti, 
the 
Austin 
Court identi­
ﬁed a new governmental interest in limiting political speech: 
an antidistortion interest. 
Austin 
found a compe
lling 
gov­
ernmental interest in preventing “the corrosive and distort­
ing effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accu­
mulated with the help of the corporate form and that have 
little or no correlation to the public’s support for the corpora­
tion’s political ideas.” 494 U. S., at 660; see 
id., 
at 659 (citing 
MCFL, 
479 U. S., at 257; 
NCPAC, 
470 U. S., at 500–501). 
B 
The Court is thus confronted with conﬂicting lines of prec­
edent: a pre-
Austin 
line that forbids restrictions on political 
speech based on the speaker’s corporate identity and a post-
Austin 
line that permits them. No case before 
Austin 
had 
held that Congress could prohibit independent expenditures 
for political speech based on the speaker’s corporate identity. 
Before 
Austin
, Congress had enacted legislation for this pur­
pose, and the Government urged the same proposition before 
this Court. See 
MCFL, supra, 
at 257 (FEC posited that 
Congress intended to “curb the political inﬂuence of ‘those 
who exercise control over large aggregations of capital’ ” 
(quoting 
Automobile Workers, 
352 U. S., at 585)); 
California 
Medical Assn. 
v. 
Federal Election Comm’n, 
453 U. S. 182, 
201 (1981) (Congress believed that “differing structures and 
purposes” of corporations and unions “may require different 
forms of regulation in order to protect the integrity of the 
electoral process”). In neither of these cases did the Court 
adopt the proposition. 
In its defense of the corporate-speech restrictions in 
§ 441b, the Government notes the antidistortion rationale on 
which 
Austin 
and its progeny rest in part, yet it all but aban­
dons reliance upon it. It argues instead that two other com­
pelling i
nterests support 
Austin
’s holding that corporate ex­
penditure restrictions are constitutional: an anticorruption 
interest, see 494 U. S., at 678 (
Stevens,
 
J., concurring), and 

Cite as: 558 U. S. 310 (2010) 
349 
Opinion of the Court 
a shareholder-protection interest, see 
id., 
at 674–675 (Bren­
nan, J., concurring). We consider the three points in turn. 
1 
As for 
Austin
’s antidistortion rationale, the Government 
does little to defend it. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45–48 (Sept. 9, 
2009). And with good reason, for the rationale cannot 
support § 441b. 
If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Con­
gress from ﬁning or ja
iling 
citizens, or associations of citi­
zens, for simply engaging in political speech. If the antidis­
tortion rationale were to be accepted, however, it would 
permit Government to ban political speech simply because 
the speaker is an association that has taken on the corporate 
form. The Government contends that 
Austin 
permits it to 
ban corporate expenditures for almost all forms of communi­
cation stemming from a corporation. See Part II–E, 
supra; 
Tr. of Oral Arg. 66 (Sept. 9, 2009); see also 
id., 
at 26–31 (Mar. 
24, 2009). If 
Austin 
were correct, the Government could 
prohibit a corporation from expressing political views in 
media beyond those presented here, such as by printing 
books. The Government responds “that the FEC has never 
applied this statute to a book,” and if it did, “there would be 
quite [a] good as-applied challenge.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 65 
(Sept. 9, 2009). This troubling assertion of brooding govern­
mental power cannot be reconciled with the conﬁdence and 
stability in civic discourse that the First Amendment must 
secure. 
Political speech is “indispensable to decisionmaking in a 
democracy, and this is no less true because the speech comes 
from a corporation rather than an individual.” 
Bellotti, 
435 
U. 
S., at 777 (footnote omitted); see 
ibid. 
(the worth of speech 
“does not depend upon the identity of its source, whether 
corporation, association, union, or individual”); 
Buckley, 
424 
U. 
S., at 48–49 (“[T]he concept that government may restrict 
the speech of some elements of our society in order to en­

350 CITIZENS UNITED 
v. 
FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N 
Opinion of the Court 
hance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the 
First Amendment”); 
Automobile Workers, supra
, at 597 
(Douglas, J., dissenting); 
CIO, 
335 U. S., at 154–155 (Rut­
ledge, J., concurring in result). This protection for speech is 
inconsistent with 
Austin
’s antidistortion rationale. 
Austin 
sought to defend the antidistortion rationale as a means to 
prevent corporations from obtaining “ ‘an unfair advantage 
in the political marketplace’ ” by using “ ‘resources amassed 
in the economic marketplace.’ ” 494 U. S., at 659 (quoting 
MCFL, supra, 
at 257). But 
Buckley 
rejected the premise 
that the Government has an interest “in equalizing the rela­
tive ability of individuals and groups to inﬂuence the out­
come of elections.” 424 U. S., at 48; see 
Bellotti, supra, 
at 791, n. 30. 
Buckley 
was speciﬁc in stating that “the 
skyrocketing cost of political campaigns” could not sustain 
the governmental prohibition. 424 U. S., at 26. The First 
Amendment’s protections do not depend on the speaker’s 
“ﬁnancial ability to engage in public discussion.” 
Id., 
at 49. 
The Court reafﬁrmed these conclusions when it invali­
dated the BCRA provision that increased the cap on con­
tributions to one candidate if the opponent made certain 
expenditures from personal funds. See 
Davis 
v. 
Federal 
Election Comm’n, 
554 U. S. 724, 742 (2008) (“Leveling elec­
toral opportunities means making and implementing judg­
ments about which strengths should be permitted to con­
tribute to the outcome of an election. The Constitution, 
however, confers upon voters, not Congress, the power to 
choose the Members of the House of Representatives, Art. I, 
§ 2, and it is a dangerous business for Congress to use the 
election laws to inﬂuence the voters’ choices”). The rule 
that political speech cannot be limited based on a speaker’s 
wealth is a necessary consequence of the premise that the 
First Amendment generally prohibits the suppression of po­
litical speech based on the speaker’s identity. 
Either as support for its antidistortion rationale or as a 
further argument, the 
Austin 
majority undertook to distin­

guish wealthy individuals from corporations on the ground 
that “[s]tate law grants corporations special advantages— 
such as limited liability, perpetual life, and favorable treat­
ment of the accumulation and distribution of assets.” 494 
U. 
S., at 658–659. This does not sufﬁce, however, to allow 
laws prohibiting speech. “It is rudimentary that the State 
cannot exact as the price of those special advantages the for­
feiture of First Amendment rights.” 
Id., 
at 680 (
Scalia,
 
J., dissenting). 
It is irrelevant for purposes of the First Amendment that 
corporate funds may “have little or no correlation to the pub­
lic’s support for the corporation’s political ideas.” 
Id., 
at 660 
(majority opinion). All speakers, including individuals and 
the media, use money amassed from the economic market­
place to fund their speech. The First Amendment protects 
the resulting speech, even if it was enabled by economic 
transactions with persons or entities who disagree with the 
speaker’s ideas. See 
id., 
at 707 (
Kennedy,
 
J., dissenting) 
(“Many persons can trace their funds to corporations, if not 
in the form of donations, then in the form of dividends, inter­
est, or salary”). 
Austin
’s antidistortion rationale would produce the dan­
gerous, and unacceptable, consequence that Congress could 
ban political speech of media corporations. See 
McConnell, 
540 U. S., at 283 (opinion of 
Thomas,
 
J.
) (“The chilling 
end­
point of the Court’s reasoning is not difﬁcult to foresee: out­
right regulation of the press”). Cf. 
Tornillo, 
418 U. S., at 
250 (alleging the existence of “vast accumulations of unre­
viewable power in the modern media empires”). Media cor­
porations are now exempt from § 441b’s ban on corporate 
expenditures. See 2 U. S. C. §§ 431(9)(B)(i), 434(f)(3)(B)(i). 
Yet media corporations accumulate wealth with the help of 
the corporate form, the largest media corporations have “im­
mense aggregations of wealth,” and the views expressed by 
media corporations often “have little or no correlation to the 
public’s support” for those views. 
Austin, 
494 U. S., at 660. 

352 CITIZENS UNITED 
v. 
FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N 
Opinion of the Court 
Thus, under the Government’s reasoning, wealthy media cor­
porations could have their voices diminished to put them on 
par with other media entities. There is no precedent for 
permitting this under the First Amendment. 
The media exemption discloses further difﬁculties with the 
law now under consideration. There is no precedent sup­

and the decline of print and broadcast media, moreover, the 
line between the media and others who wish to comment on 
political and social issues becomes far more blurred. 
The law’s exception for media corporations is, on its own 
terms, all but an admission of the invalidity of the antidistor­
tion rationale. And the exemption results in a further, sep­
arate reason for ﬁnding this law invalid: Again by its own 
terms, the law exempts some corporations but covers others, 
even though both have the need or the motive to communi­
cate their views. The exemption applies to media corpora­
tions owned or controlled by corporations that have diverse 
and substantial investments and participate in endeavors 
other than news. So even assuming the most doubtful prop­
osition that a news organization has a right to speak when 
others do not, the exemption would allow a conglomerate 
that owns both a media business and an unrelated business to 
inﬂuence or control the media in order to advance its overall 
business interest. At the same time, some other corpora­
tion, with an identical business interest but no media outlet 
in its ownership structure, would be forbidden to speak or

inform the public about the same issue. This differential 
treatment cannot be squared with the First Amendment. 
There is simply no support for the view that the First 
Amendment, as originally understood, would permit the sup­
pression of political speech by media corporations. The 
Framers may not have anticipated modern business and 
media corporations. See

ring in judgment). Yet television networks and major news­
papers owned by media corporations have become the most 
important means of mass communication in modern times. 
The First Amendment was certainly not understood to con­
done the suppression of political speech in society’s most sa­
lient media. It was understood as a response to the repres­
sion of speech and the press that had existed in England and 
the heavy taxes on the press that were imposed in the Colo­
nies. See

The great debates between the Federalists and the

at 367 (

comprehensive, and vital to society’s deﬁnition of itself; there 
were no limits on the sources of speech and knowledge. See

The purpose and effect of this law is to prevent corpora­

Austin

Presidential administrations on many issues, as a matter of 
routine and often in private. An 
amici 
brief ﬁled on behalf 
of Montana and 25 other States notes that lobbying and cor­
porate communications with elected ofﬁcials occur on a regu­
lar basis. Brief for State of Montana et al. 19. When that 
phenomenon is coupled with § 441b, the result is that smaller 
or nonproﬁt corporations cannot raise a voice to object when 
other corporations, including those with vast wealth, are co­
operating with the Government. That cooperation may 
sometimes be voluntary, or it may be at the demand of a 
Government ofﬁcial who uses his or her authority, inﬂuence, 
and power to threaten corporations to support the Govern­
ment’s policies. Those kinds of interactions are often un­
known and unseen. The speech that § 441b forbids, though, 
is public, and all can judge its content and purpose. Ref­
erences to massive corporate treasuries should not mask 
the real operation of this law. Rhetoric ought not obscure 
reality. 
Even if § 441b’s expenditure ban were constitutional, 
wealthy corporations could still lobby elected ofﬁcials, al­

Opinion of the Court 
though smaller corporations may not have the resources to 
do so. And wealthy individuals and unincorporated associa­
tions can spend unlimited amounts on independent expendi­
tures. See, 
e. g., WRTL, 
551 U. S., at 503–504 (opinion of 
Scalia,
 
J.) (“In the 2004 election cycle, a mere 24 individuals 
contributed an astounding total of $142 m
illion to [26 U. S. C. 
§ 527 organizations]”). Yet certain disfavored associations 
of citizens—those that have taken on the corporate form— 
are penalized for engaging in the same political speech. 
When Government seeks to use its full power, including 
the criminal law, to command where a person may get his 
or her information or what distrusted source he or she may 
not hear, it uses censorship to control thought. This is 
unlawful. The First Amendment conﬁrms the freedom to 
think for ourselves. 
2 
What we have said also shows the invalidity of other argu­
ments made by the Government. For the most part relin­
quishing the antidistortion rationale, the Government falls 
back on the argument that corporate political speech can be 
banned in order to prevent corruption or its appearance. In 
Buckley, 
the Court found this interest “sufﬁciently impor­
tant” to allow limits on contributions but did not extend that 
reasoning to expenditure limits. 424 U. S., at 25. When 
Buckley 
examined an expenditure ban, it found “that the 
governmental interest in preventing corruption and the ap­
pearance of corruption [was] inadequate to justify [the ban] 
on independent expenditures.” 
Id.,

With regard to large direct contributions, 
Buckley 
rea­
soned that they could be given “to secure a political

quo,
”

Buckley

The 
Buckley 
Court, nevertheless, sus­
tained limits on direct contributions in order to ensure 
against the reality or appearance of corruption. That case 
did not extend this rationale to independent expenditures, 
and the Court does not do so here. 
“The absence of prearrangement and coordination of an 
expenditure with the candidate or his agent not only under­
mines the value of the expenditure to the candidate, but also 
alleviates the danger that expenditures will be given as a 
quid pro quo 
for improper commitments from the candidate.” 
Buckley, 
424 U. S., at 47; see 
ibid. 
(independent expenditures 
have a “substantially diminished potential for abuse”). Lim­
its on independent expenditures, such as § 441b, have a chill­
ing effect extending well beyond the Government’s interest 
in preventing 
quid pro quo 
corruption. The anticorruption 
interest is not sufﬁcient to displace the speech here in ques­
tion. Indeed, 26 States do not restrict independent expendi­
tures by for-proﬁt corporations. The Government does not 
claim that these expenditures have corrupted the political 
process in those States. See Supp. Brief for Appellee 18,

3; Supp. Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the United 
States of America as

A single footnote in 
Bellotti 
purported to leave open the 
possibility that corporate independent expenditures could be 
shown to cause corruption. 435 U. S., at 788, n. 26. For the 
reasons explained above, we now conclude that independent 
expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not 
give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption. 
Dicta in

’s footnote suggested that “a corporation’s 
right to speak on issues of general public interest implies no

that invalidated the fed­

might well be able to demonstrate the existence of a danger 
of real or apparent corruption in independent expenditures 
by corporations to inﬂuence candidate elections.” 435 U. S., 
at 788, n. 26. 
Buckley, 
however, struck down a ban on inde­
pendent expenditures to support candidates that covered 
corporations, 424 U. S., at 23, 39, n. 45, and explained that 
“the distinction between discussion of issues and candidates 
and advocacy of election or defeat of candidates may often 
dissolve in practical application,” 
id., 
at 42. 
Bellotti
’s dic­
tum is thus supported only by a law review student com­
ment, which misinterpreted 
Buckley. 
See Comment, The 
Regulation of Union Political Activity: Majority and Minor­

held to different and more stringent standards than an indi­
vidual or other associations under a regulatory scheme for 
campaign ﬁnancing”). 
Seizing on this aside in 
Bellotti
’s footnote, the Court in 
NRWC 
did say there is a “sufﬁcient” governmental inter­
est in “ensur[ing] that substantial aggregations of wealth 
amassed” by corporations would not “be used to incur politi­
cal debts from legislators who are aided by the contribu­
tions.” 459 U. S., at 207–208 (citing

thus involved contribution limits, see 
NCPAC, 
supra, 
at 495–496, which, unlike limits on independent ex­
penditures, have been an accepted means to prevent 
quid

corruption, see 
McConnell, 
540 U. S., at 136–138, 
and n. 40; 
MCFL, supra, 
at 259–260. Citizens United has 
not made direct contributions to candidates, and it has not 
suggested that the Court should reconsider whether contri­
bution limits should be subjected to rigorous First Amend­
ment scrutiny. 
When 
Buckley 
identiﬁed a sufﬁciently important govern­
mental interest in preventing corruption or the appearance 
of corruption, that interest was limited to 
quid pro quo 
cor­
ruption. See 
McConnell, supra, 
at 296–298 (opinion of 
Ken­

The fact that speakers may have inﬂuence over or ac­
cess to elected ofﬁcials does not mean that these ofﬁcials 
are corrupt: 
“Favoritism and inﬂuence are no
t... 
avoidable in repre­
sentative politics. It is in the nature of an elected rep­
resentative to favor certain policies, and, by necessary 
corollary, to favor the voters and contributors who sup­
port those policies. It is well understood that a sub­
stantial and legitimate reason, if not the only reason, to 
cast a vote for, or to make a contribution to, one candi­
date over another is that the candidate will respond by 
producing those political outcomes the supporter favors. 
Democracy is premised on responsiveness.”

360 CITIZENS UNITED 
v. 
FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N 
Opinion of the Court 
The appearance of inﬂuence or access, furthermore, will 
not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy. By 
deﬁnition, an independent expenditure is political speech 
presented to the electorate that is not coordinated with a 
candidate. See 
Buckley, supra, 
at 46. The fact that a cor­
poration, or any other speaker, is w
illing to 
spend money to 
try to persuade voters presupposes that the people have the 
ultimate inﬂuence over elected ofﬁcials. This is inconsistent 
with any suggestion that the electorate will refuse “ ‘to take 
part in democratic governance’ ” because of additional politi­
cal speech made by a corporation or any other speaker.

Connell, supra, 
at 144 (quoting 
Nixon

Caperton 
v. 
A. T. Massey Coal Co., 
556 U. S. 868 (2009), is 
not to the contrary. 
Caperton 
held that a judge was re­
quired to recuse himself “when a person with a personal 
stake in a particular case had a signiﬁcant and disproportion­
ate inﬂuence in placing the judge on the case by raising funds 
or directing the judge’s election campaign when the case was 
pending or imminent.” 
Id., 
at 884. The remedy of recusal 
was based on a litigant’s due process right to a fair trial 
before an unbiased judge. See 
Withrow 
v. 
Larkin, 
421 U. S. 
35, 46 (1975). 
Caperton
’s holding was limited to the rule 
that the judge must be recused, not that the litigant’s politi­
cal speech could be banned. 
The 
McConnell 
record was “over 100,000 pages” long, 
Mc­
Connell I,

direct examples of votes being exchanged for . . . expendi­
tures,” 
id., 
at 560 (opinion of Kollar-Kotelly, J.). This con­
ﬁrms 
Buckley
’s reasoning that independent expenditures do 
not lead to, or create the appearance of, 
quid pro quo 
corrup­
tion. In fact, there is only scant evidence that independent 
expenditures even ingratiate. See 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 555– 
557 (opinion of Kollar-Kotelly, J.). Ingratiation and access, 
in any event, are not corruption. The BCRA record estab­
lishes that certain donations to political parties, called “soft

money,” were made to gain access to elected ofﬁcials.

at 125, 130–131, 146–152; see 
McConnell I, 
251 F. Supp. 2d, at 471–481, 491–506 (opinion of Kollar-
Kotelly, J.); 
id., 
at 842–843, 858–859 (opinion of Leon, J.). 
This case, however, is about independent expenditures, not 
soft money. When Congress ﬁnds that a problem exists, we 
must give that ﬁnding due deference; but Congress may not 
choose an unconstitutional remedy. If elected ofﬁcials suc­
cumb to improper inﬂuences from independent expenditures; 
if they surrender their best judgment; and if they put expedi­
ency before principle, then surely there is cause for concern. 
We must give weight to attempts by Congress to seek to 
dispel either the appearance or the reality of these inﬂu­
ences. The remedies enacted by law, however, must comply 
with the First Amendment; and it is our law and our tradi­
tion that more speech, not less, is the governing rule. An 
outright ban on corporate political speech during the critical 
preelection period is not a permissible remedy. Here Con­
gress has created categorical bans on speech that are asym­
metrical to preventing 
quid pro quo 
corruption. 
3 
The Government contends further that corporate inde­
pendent expenditures can be limited because of its interest 
in protecting dissenting shareholders from being compelled 
to fund corporate political speech. This asserted interest, 
like 
Austin
’s antidistortion rationale, would allow the Gov­
ernment to ban the political speech even of media corpora­
tions. See 
supra, 
at 352–354. Assume, for example, that a 
shareholder of a corporation that owns a newspaper dis­
agrees with the political views the newspaper expresses. 
See 
Austin, 
494 U. S., at 687 (
Scalia,
 
J., dissenting). Under 
the Government’s view, that potential disagreement could 
give the Government the authority to restrict the media cor­
poration’s political speech. The First Amendment does not 
allow that power. There is, furthermore, little evidence of

abuse that cannot be corrected by shareholders “through the 
procedures of corporate democracy.” 
Bellotti, 
435 U. S., at 
794; see 
ibid.
,n .3 4
. 
Those reasons are sufﬁcient to reject this shareholder-
protection interest; and, moreover, the statute is both under-
inclusive and overinclusive. As to the ﬁrst, if Congress had 
been seeking to protect dissenting shareholders, it would not 
have banned corporate speech in only certain media within 
30 or 60 days before an election. A dissenting shareholder’s 
interests would be implicated by speech in any media at any 
time. As to the second, the statute is overinclusive because 
it covers all corporations, including nonproﬁt corporations 
and for-proﬁt corporations with only single shareholders. 
As to other corporations, the remedy is not to restrict speech 
but to consider and explore other regulatory mechanisms. 
The regulatory mechanism here, based on speech, contra­
venes the First Amendment.

We need not reach the question whether the Government 
has a compe
lling i
nterest in preventing foreign individuals or 
associations from inﬂuencing our Nation’s political process. 
Cf. 2 U. S. C. § 441e (contribution and expenditure ban ap­
plied to “foreign national[s]”). Section 441b is not limited 
to corporations or associations that were created in foreign 
countries or funded predominantly by foreign shareholders. 
Section 441b therefore would be overbroad even if we as­
sumed, 
arguendo, 
that the Government has a compe
lling in­
terest in limiting foreign inﬂuence over our political process. 
See 
Broadrick,

in 
Buckley

For the reasons above, it must be concluded that

Austin 
is undermined by experience since its announce­
ment. Political speech is so ingrained in our culture that 
speakers ﬁnd ways to circumvent campaign ﬁnance laws. 
See, 
e. g., McConnell, 
540 U. S., at 176–177 (“Given BCRA’s 
tighter restrictions on the raising and spending of soft 
money, the incentive
s... t o 
exploit [26 U. S. C. § 527] organi­
zations will only increase”). Our Nation’s speech dynamic is 
changing, and informative voices should not have to circum­
vent onerous restrictions to exercise their First Amendment 
rights. Speakers have become adept at presenting citizens 
with sound bites, talking points, and scripted messages that 
dominate the 24-hour news cycle. Corporations, like indi­
viduals, do not have monolithic views. On certain topics 
corporations may possess valuable expertise, leaving them 
the best equipped to point out errors or fallacies in speech 
of all sorts, including the speech of candidates and elected 
ofﬁcials. 
Rapid changes in technology—and the creative dynamic 
inherent in the concept of free expression—counsel against 
upholding a law that restricts political speech in certain 
media or by certain speakers. See Part II–C, 
supra. 
Today, 30-second television ads may be the most effective 
way to convey a political message. See 
McConnell, supra, 
at 261 (opinion of 
Scalia,
 
J.). Soon, however, it may be that 
Internet sources, such as blogs and social networking Web 
sites, will provide citizens with signiﬁcant information about 
political candidates and issues. Yet, § 441b would seem to 
ban a blog post expressly advocating the election or defeat 
of a candidate if that blog were created with corporate funds. 
See 2 U. S. C. § 441b(a); 
MCFL, supra, 
at 249. The First 
Amendment does not permit Congress to make these cate­
gorical distinctions based on the corporate identity of the 
speaker and the content of the political speech.

Opinion of the Court 
No serious reliance interests are at stake. As the Court 
stated in 
Payne 
v. 
Tennessee, 
501 U. S. 808, 828 (1991), reli­
ance interests are important considerations in property and 
contract cases, where parties may have acted in conformance 
with existing legal rules in order to conduct transactions. 
Here, though, parties have been prevented from acting— 
corporations have been banned from making independent 
expenditures. Legislatures may have enacted bans on cor­
porate expenditures believing that those bans were con­
stitutional. This is not a compe
lling i
nterest for 
stare 
decisis. 
If it were, legislative acts could prevent us from 
overruling our own precedents, thereby interfering with our 
duty “to say what the law is.” 
Marbury 
v. 
Madison, 
1 
Cranch 137, 177 (1803). 
Due consideration leads to this conclusion: 
Austin, 
494 
U. 
S. 652, should be and now is overruled. We return to 
the principle established in 
Buckley 
and 
Bellotti 
that the 
Government may not suppress political speech on the basis 
of the speaker’s corporate identity. No sufﬁcient govern­
mental interest justiﬁes limits on the political speech of non­
proﬁt or for-proﬁt corporations. 
D 
Austin 
is overruled, so it provides no basis for allowing 
the Government to limit corporate independent expendi­
tures. As the Government appears to concede, overruling 
Austin 
“effectively invalidate[s] not only BCRA Section 203, 
but also 2 U. S. C. 441b’s prohibition on the use of corporate 
treasury funds for express advocacy.” Brief for Appellee 33, 
n. 
12. Section 441b’s restrictions on corporate independent 
expenditures are therefore invalid and cannot be applied to 
Hillary. 
Given our conclusion we are further required to overrule 
the part of 
McConnell 
that upheld BCRA § 203’s extension of 
§ 441b’s restrictions on corporate independent expenditures. 
See 540 U. S., at 203–209. The 
McConnell 
Court relied on 

366 CITIZENS UNITED 
v. 
FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N 
Opinion of the Court 
the antidistortion interest recognized in 
Austin 
to uphold a 
greater restriction on speech than the restriction upheld in 
Austin, 
see 540 U. S., at 205, and we have found this interest 
unconvincing and insufﬁcient. This part of 
McConnell 
is 
now overruled.

A
 
Citizens United next challenges BCRA’s disclaimer and 
disclosure provisions as applied to 
Hillary 
and the three ad­
vertisements for the movie. Under BCRA § 311, televised 
electioneering communications funded by anyone other than 
a candidate must include a disclaimer that “ ‘–––––– is re­
sponsible for the content of this advertising.’ ” 2 U. S. C. 
§ 441d(d)(2). The required statement must be made in a 
“clearly spoken manner,” and displayed on the screen in a 
“clearly readable manner” for at least four seconds. 
Ibid. 
It must state that the communication “is not authorized by 
any candidate or candidate’s committee”; it must also display 
the name and address (or Web site address) of the person or 
group that funded the advertisement. § 441d(a)(3). Under 
BCRA § 201, any person who spends more than $10,000 
on electioneering communications within a calendar year 
must ﬁle a disclosure statement with the FEC. 2 U. S. C. 
§ 434(f)(1). That statement must identify the person making 
the expenditure, the amount of the expenditure, the election 
to which the communication was directed, and the names of 
certain contributors. § 434(f)(2). 
Disclaimer and disclosure requirements may burden the 
ability to speak, but they “impose no ce
iling on 
campaign-
related activities,” 
Buckley, 
424 U. S., at 64, and “do not pre­
vent anyone from speaking,” 
McConnell, supra, 
at 201 (in­
ternal quotation marks and brackets omitted). The Court 
has subjected these requirements to “exacting scrutiny,” 
which requires a “substantial relation” between the disclo­
sure requirement and a “sufﬁciently important” governmen­

Opinion of the Court 
tal interest. 
Buckley, supra, 
at 64, 66 (internal quotation 
marks omitted); see 
McConnell, supra, 
at 231–232. 
In 
Buckley, 
the Court explained that disclosure could be 
justiﬁed based on a governmental interest in “provid[ing] the 
electorate with information” about the sources of election-
related spending. 424 U. S., at 66. The 
McConnell 
Court 
applied this interest in rejecting facial challenges to BCRA 
§§ 201 and 311. 540 U. S., at 196. There was evidence in 
the record that independent groups were running election-
related advertisements “ ‘while hiding behind dubious and 
misleading names.’ ” 
Id., 
at 197 (quoting 
McConnell I, 
251 
F. 
Supp. 2d, at 237). The Court therefore upheld BCRA 
§§ 201 and 311 on the ground that they would help citizens 
“ ‘make informed choices in the political marketplace.’ ” 540 
U. 
S., at 197 (quoting 
McConnell I, supra, 
at 237); see 540 
U. 
S., at 231. 
Although both provisions were facially upheld, the Court 
acknowledged that as-applied challenges would be available 
if a group could show a “ ‘reasonable probability’ ” that disclo­
sure of its contributors’ names “ ‘will subject them to threats, 
harassment, or reprisals from either Government ofﬁcials 
or private parties.’ ” 
Id., 
at 198 (quoting 
Buckley, supra, 
at 74). 
For the reasons stated below, we ﬁnd the statute valid as 
applied to the ads for the movie and to the movie itself. 
B 
Citizens United sought to broadcast one 30-second and two 
10-second ads to promote 
Hillary. 
Under FEC regulations, 
a communication that “[p]roposes a commercial transaction” 
was not subject to 2 U. S. C. § 441b’s restrictions on corporate 
or union funding of electioneering communications. 11 CFR 
§ 114.15(b)(3)(ii). The regulations, however, do not exempt 
those communications from the disclaimer and disclosure re­
quirements in BCRA §§ 201 and 311. See 72 Fed. Reg. 
72901 (2007). 

368 CITIZENS UNITED 
v. 
FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N 
Opinion of the Court 
Citizens United argues that the disclaimer requirements 
in § 311 are unconstitutional as applied to its ads. It con­
tends that the governmental interest in providing informa­
tion to the electorate does not justify requiring disclaimers 
for any commercial advertisements, including the ones 
at issue here. We disagree. The ads fall within BCRA’s 
deﬁnition of an “electioneering communication”: They re­
ferred to then-Senator Clinton by name shortly before a pri­
mary and contained pejorative references to her candidacy. 
See 530 F. Supp. 2d, at 276, nn. 2–4. The disclaimers re­
quired by § 311 “provid[e] the electorate with information,” 
McConnell, supra, 
at 196, and “insure that the voters are 
fully informed” about the person or group who is speaking, 
Buckley, supra, 
at 76; see also 
Bellotti, 
435 U. S., at 792, 
n. 
32 (“Identiﬁcation of the source of advertising may be re­
quired as a means of disclosure, so that the people will be 
able to evaluate the arguments to which they are being sub­
jected”). At the very least, the disclaimers avoid confusion 
by making clear that the ads are not funded by a candidate 
or political party. 
Citizens United argues that § 311 is underinclusive be­
cause it requires disclaimers for broadcast advertisements 
but not for print or Internet advertising. It asserts that 
§ 311 decreases both the quantity and effectiveness of the 
group’s speech by forcing it to devote four seconds of each 
advertisement to the spoken disclaimer. We rejected these 
arguments in 
McConnell, supra, 
at 230–231. And we now 
adhere to that decision as it pertains to the disclosure 
provisions. 
As a ﬁnal point, Citizens United claims that, in any event, 
the disclosure requirements in § 201 must be conﬁned to 
speech that is the functional equivalent of express advocacy. 
The principal opinion in 
WRTL 
limited 2 U. S. C. § 441b’s re­
strictions on independent expenditures to express advocacy 
and its functional equivalent. 551 U. S., at 469–476 (opinion 
of 
Roberts,
 
C. J.). Citizens United seeks to import a simi­

Cite as: 558 U. S. 310 (2010) 
369 
Opinion of the Court 
lar distinction into BCRA’s disclosure requirements. We re­
ject this contention. 
The Court has explained that disclosure is a less restric­
tive alternative to more comprehensive regulations of 
speech. See, 
e. g., MCFL, 
479 U. S., at 262. In 
Buckley, 
the 
Court upheld a disclosure requirement for independent ex­
penditures even though it invalidated a provision that im­
posed a ce
iling on 
those expenditures. 424 U. S., at 75–76. 
In 
McConnell, 
three Justices who would have found § 441b 
to be unconstitutional nonetheless voted to uphold BCRA’s 
disclosure and disclaimer requirements. 540 U. S., at 321 
(opinion of 
Kennedy,
 
J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and 
Scalia,
 
J.
). And the Court has upheld registration and dis­
closure requirements on lobbyists, even though Congress has 
no power to ban lobbying itself. 
United States 
v. 
Harriss, 
347 U. S. 612, 625 (1954) (Congress “has merely provided for 
a modicum of information from those who for hire attempt 
to inﬂuence legislation or who collect or spend funds for 
that purpose”). For these reasons, we reject Citizens Unit­
ed’s contention that the disclosure requirements must be lim­
ited to speech that is the functional equivalent of express 
advocacy. 
Citizens United also disputes that an informational inter­
est justiﬁes the application of § 201 to its ads, which only 
attempt to persuade viewers to see the ﬁlm. Even if it dis­
closed the funding sources for the ads, Citizens United says, 
the information would not help viewers make informed 
choices in the political marketplace. This is similar to the 
argument rejected above with respect to disclaimers. Even 
if the ads only pertain to a commercial transaction, the public 
has an interest in knowing who is speaking about a candidate 
shortly before an election. Because the informational inter­
est alone is sufﬁcient to justify application of § 201 to these 
ads, it is not necessary to consider the Government’s other 
asserted interests. 

370 CITIZENS UNITED 
v. 
FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N 
Opinion of the Court 
Last, Citizens United argues that disclosure requirements 
can chill donations to an organization by exposing donors to 
retaliation. Some 
amici 
point to recent events in which do­
nors to certain causes were blacklisted, threatened, or other­
wise targeted for retaliation. See Brief for Institute for 
Justice as 
Amicus Curiae 
13–16; Brief for Alliance Defense 
Fund as 
Amicus Curiae 
16–22. In 
McConnell, 
the Court 
recognized that § 201 would be unconstitutional as applied to 
an organization if there were a reasonable probability that 
the group’s members would face threats, harassment, or re­
prisals if their names were disclosed. 540 U. S., at 198. 
The examples cited by 
amici 
are cause for concern. Citi­
zens United, however, has offered no evidence that its mem­
bers may face similar threats or reprisals. To the contrary, 
Citizens United has been disclosing its donors for years and 
has identiﬁed no instance of harassment or retaliation. 
Shareholder objections raised through the procedures of 
corporate democracy, see 
Bellotti, supra, 
at 794, and n. 34, 
can be more effective today because modern technology 
makes disclosures rapid and informative. A campaign ﬁ­
nance system that pairs corporate independent expenditures 
with effective disclosure has not existed before today. It 
must be noted, furthermore, that many of Congress’ ﬁndings 
in passing BCRA were premised on a system without ade­
quate disclosure. See 
McConnell, 
540 U. S., at 128 (“[T]he 
public may not have been fully informed about the sponsor­
ship of so-called issue ads”); 
id., 
at 196–197 (citing 
McConnell 
I, 
251 F. Supp. 2d, at 237). With the advent of the Internet, 
prompt disclosure of expenditures can provide shareholders 
and citizens with the information needed to hold corporations 
and elected ofﬁcials accountable for their positions and sup­
porters. Shareholders can determine whether their corpo­
ration’s political speech advances the corporation’s interest 
in making proﬁts, and citizens can see whether elected ofﬁ­
cials are “ ‘in the pocket’ of so-called moneyed interests.” 
540 U. S., at 259 (opinion of 
Scalia,
 
J.); see 
MCFL, supra, 
at 

Cite as: 558 U. S. 310 (2010) 
371 
Opinion of the Court 
261. 
The First Amendment protects political speech; and 
disclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react to the 
speech of corporate entities in a proper way. This transpar­
ency enables the electorate to make informed decisions and 
give proper weight to different speakers and messages. 
C 
For the same reasons we uphold the application of BCRA 
§§ 201 and 311 to the ads, we afﬁrm their application to 
Hil­
lary. 
We ﬁnd no constitutional impediment to the applica­
tion of BCRA’s disclaimer and disclosure requirements to a 
movie broadcast via video-on-demand. And there has been 
no showing that, as applied in this case, these requirements 
would impose a chill on speech or expression. 
V 
When word concerning the plot of the movie 
Mr. Smith 
Goes to Washington 
reached the circles of Government, some 
ofﬁcials sought, by persuasion, to discourage its distribution. 
See Smoodin, “Compulsory” Viewing for Every Citizen: 
Mr. Smith 
and the Rhetoric of Reception, 35 Cinema Journal 
3, 19, and n. 52 (Winter 1996) (citing Mr. Smith Riles Wash­
ington, Time, Oct. 30, 1939, p. 49); Nugent, Capra’s Capitol 
Offense, N. Y . Times, Oct. 29, 1939, p. X5. Under 
Austin, 
though, ofﬁcials could have done more than discourage its 
distribution—they could have banned the ﬁlm. After all, it, 
like 
Hillary, 
was speech funded by a corporation that was 
critical of Members of Congress. 
Mr. Smith Goes to Wash­
ington 
may be ﬁction and caricature; but ﬁction and carica­
ture can be a powerful force. 
Modern day movies, television comedies, or skits on You-
Tube.com 
might portray public ofﬁcials or public policies in 
unﬂattering ways. Yet if a covered transmission during the 
blackout period creates the background for candidate en­
dorsement or opposition, a felony occurs solely because a cor­
poration, other than an exempt media corporation, has made

the “purchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance, deposit, 
or gift of money or anything of value” in order to engage in 
political speech. 2 U. S. C. § 431(9)(A)(i). Speech would be 
suppressed in the realm where its necessity is most evident: 
in the public dialogue preceding a real election. Govern­
ments are often hostile to speech, but under our law and our 
tradition it seems stranger than ﬁction for our Government 
to make this political speech a crime. Yet this is the stat­
ute’s purpose and design. 
Some members of the public might consider 
Hillary 
to be 
insightful and instructive; some might ﬁnd it to be neither 
high art nor a fair discussion on how to set the Nation’s 
course; still others simply might suspend judgment on these 
points but decide to think more about issues and candidates. 
Those choices and assessments, however, are not for the Gov­
ernment to make. “The First Amendment underwrites the 
freedom to experiment and to create in the realm of thought 
and speech. Citizens must be free to use new forms, and 
new forums, for the expression of ideas. The civic discourse 
belongs to the people, and the Government may not pre­
scribe the means used to conduct it.” 
McConnell, supra, 
at 
341 (opinion of 
Kennedy,
 
J.
). 
The judgment of the District Court is reversed with re­
spect to the constitutionality of 2 U. S. C. § 441b’s restrictions 
on corporate independent expenditures. The judgment is 
afﬁrmed with respect to BCRA’s disclaimer and disclosure 
requirements. The case is remanded for further proceed­
ings consistent with this opinion. 
It is so ordered.

Justice
 
Roberts,
 
with whom 
Justice
 
Alito
 
joins, concurring. 
The Government urges us in this case to uphold a direct 
prohibition on political speech. It asks us to embrace a the­
ory of the First Amendment that would allow censorship not 
only of television and radio broadcasts, but of pamphlets,

posters, the Internet, and virtually any other medium that 
corporations and unions might ﬁnd useful in expressing their 
views on matters of public concern. Its theory, if accepted, 
would empower the Government to prohibit newspapers 
from running editorials or opinion pieces supporting or op­
posing candidates for ofﬁce, so long as the newspapers were 
owned by corporations—as the major ones are. First 
Amendment rights could be conﬁned to individuals, subvert­
ing the vibrant public discourse that is at the foundation of 
our democracy. 
The Court properly rejects that theory, and I join its opin­
ion in full. The First Amendment protects more than just 
the individual on a soapbox and the lonely pamphleteer. I 
write separately to address the important principles of judi­
cial restraint and 
stare decisis 
implicated in this case.

But I cannot agree with my dissenting colleagues on how 
these principles apply in this case. 
The majority’s step-by-step analysis accords with our 
standard practice of avoiding broad constitutional questions 
except when necessary to decide the case before us. The 
majority begins by addressing—and quite properly reject-
ing—Citizens United’s statutory claim that 2 U. S. C. § 441b 
does not actually cover its production and distribution of 
Hillary: The Movie 
(hereinafter 
Hillary
). If there were 
a valid basis for deciding this statutory claim in Citizens 
United’s favor (and thereby avoiding constitutional adjudica­
tion), it would be proper to do so. Indeed, that is precisely 
the approach the Court took just last Term in 
Northwest 
Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No. One 
v. 
Holder, 
557 U. S. 
193 (2009), when eight Members of the Court agreed to de­
cide the case on statutory grounds instead of reaching the 
appellant’s broader argument that the Voting Rights Act is 
unconstitutional. 
It is only because the majority rejects Citizens United’s 
statutory claim that it proceeds to consider the group’s vari­
ous constitutional arguments, beginning with its narrowest 
claim (that 
Hillary 
is not the functional equivalent of ex­
press advocacy) and proceeding to its broadest claim (that 
Austin 
v. 
Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 
494 U. S. 652 
(1990), should be overruled). This is the same order of oper­
ations followed by the contro
lling opinion in 
Federal Elec­
tion Comm’n 
v. 
Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., 
551 U. S. 449 
(2007) (
WRTL
). There the appellant was able to prevail on 
its narrowest constitutional argument because its broadcast 
ads did not qualify as the functional equivalent of express 
advocacy; there was thus no need to go on to address the 
broader claim that 
McConnell 
v. 
Federal Election Comm’n, 
540 U. S. 93 (2003), should be overruled. 
WRTL, 
551 U. S.,

different—not, as the dissent suggests, because the approach 
taken in

but because, in the absence of any valid narrower ground of 
decision, there is no way to avoid Citizens United’s broader 
constitutional argument. 
The dissent advocates an approach to addressing Citizens 
United’s claims that I ﬁnd quite perplexing. It presumably 
agrees with the majority that Citizens United’s narrower 
statutory and constitutional arguments lack merit—other­
wise its conclusion that the group should lose this case would 
make no sense. Despite agreeing that these narrower argu­
ments fail, however, the dissent argues that the majority 
should nonetheless latch on to one of them in order to avoid 
reaching the broader constitutional question of whether 
Aus­
tin 
remains good law. It even suggests that the Court’s fail­
ure to adopt one of these concededly meritless arguments is 
a sign that the majority is not “serious about judicial re­
straint.” 
Post, 
at 408. 
This approach is based on a false premise: that our practice 
of avoiding unnecessary (and unnecessarily broad) constitu­
tional holdings somehow trumps our obligation faithfully to 
interpret the law. It should go without saying, however, 
that we cannot embrace a narrow ground of decision simply 
because it is narrow; it must also be right. Thus while it is 
true that “[i]f it is not necessary to decide more, it is neces­
sary not to decide more,” 
post, 
at 405 (internal quotation 
marks omitted), sometimes it 
is 
necessary to decide more. 
There is a difference between judicial restraint and judicial 
abdication. When constitutional questions are “indispen­
sably necessary” to resolving the case at hand, “the court 
must meet and decide them.”

Because it is necessary to reach Citizens United’s broader 
argument that 
Austin 
should be overruled, the debate over 
whether to consider this claim on an as-applied or facial basis 
strikes me as largely beside the point. Citizens United 
has standing—it is being injured by the Government’s en­
forcement of the Act. Citizens United has a constitutional

claim—the Act violates the First Amendment, because it 
prohibits political speech. The Government has a defense— 
the Act may be enforced, consistent with the First Amend­
ment, against corporations. Whether the claim or the de­
fense prevails is the question before us. 
Given the nature of that claim and defense, it makes no 
difference of any substance whether this case is resolved by 
invalidating the statute on its face or only as applied to Citi­
zens United. Even if considered in as-applied terms, a hold­
ing in this case that the Act may not be applied to Citizens 
United—because corporations as well as individuals enjoy 
the pertinent First Amendment rights—would mean that 
any other corporation raising the same challenge would also 
win. Likewise, a conclusion that the Act may be applied 
to Citizens United—because it is constitutional to prohibit 
corporate political speech—would similarly govern future 
cases. Regardless whether we label Citizens United’s claim 
a “facial” or “as-applied” challenge, the consequences of the 
Court’s decision are the same.

II 
The text and purpose of the First Amendment point in the 
same direction: Congress may not prohibit political speech, 
even if the speaker is a corporation or union. What makes 
this case difﬁcult is the need to confront our prior decision 
in 
Austin. 
This is the ﬁrst case in which we have been asked to over­
rule 
Austin, 
and thus it is also the ﬁrst in which we have 
had reason to consider how much weight to give 
stare decisis 
in assessing its continued validity. The dissent erroneously

Fidelity to precedent—the policy of 
stare decisis
—is vital 
to the proper exercise of the judicial function. “
Stare deci­
sis 
is the preferred course because it promotes the even­
handed, predictable, and consistent development of legal 
principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contrib­
utes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial proc­

Stare decisis 
is instead a “principle of policy.” 
Helvering, 
supra, 
at 119. When considering whether to reexamine a 
prior erroneous holding, we must balance the importance of 
having constitutional questions 
decided 
against the impor­
tance of having them 
decided right. 
As Justice Jackson ex­
plained, this requires a “sober appraisal of the disadvantages 
of the innovation as well as those of the questioned case, 
a weighing of practical effects of one against the other.” 
Jackson, Decisional Law and 
Stare Decisis, 
30 A. B. A. J. 
334 (1944). 
In conducting this balancing, we must keep in mind that 
stare decisis 
is not an end in itself. It is instead “the means 
by which we ensure that the law will not merely change er­
ratically, but will develop in a principled and intelligible fash­
ion.” 
Vasquez 
v. 
Hillery, 
474 U. S. 254, 265 (1986). Its 
greatest purpose is to serve a constitutional ideal—the rule 
of law. It follows that in the unusual circumstance when 
ﬁdelity to any particular precedent does more to damage this 
constitutional ideal than to advance it, we must be more will­
ing to depart from that precedent. 
Thus, for example, if the precedent under consideration 
itself departed from the Court’s jurisprudence, returning to 
the “ ‘intrinsically sounder’ doctrine established in prior 
cases” may “better serv[e] the values of 
stare decisis 
than 
would following [the] more recently decided case inconsistent 
with the decisions that came before it.”

reafﬁrming or extending it, might better preserve the law’s 
coherence and curtail the precedent’s disruptive effects. 
Likewise, if adherence to a precedent actually impedes the 
stable and orderly adjudication of future cases, its 
stare deci­
sis 
effect is also diminished. This can happen in a number 
of circumstances, such as when the precedent’s validity is so 
hotly contested that it cannot reliably function as a basis for 
decision in future cases, when its rationale threatens to 
upend our settled jurisprudence in related areas of law, and 
when the precedent’s underlying reasoning has become so 
discredited that the Court cannot keep the precedent alive 
without jury-rigging new and different justiﬁcations to shore 
up the original mistake. See, 
e. g., Pearson 
v. 
Callahan,

U.

stare decisis

retical basis”). 
B 
These considerations weigh against retaining our decision 
in 
Austin. 
First, as the majority explains, that decision was 
an “aberration” insofar as it departed from the robust protec­
tions we had granted political speech in our earlier cases. 
Ante, 
at 355; see also 
Buckley, supra
; 
First Nat. Bank of 
Boston 
v. 
Bellotti, 
435 U. S. 765 (1978). 
Austin 
undermined 
the careful line that 
Buckley 
drew to distinguish limits on 
contributions to candidates from limits on independent ex­
penditures on speech. 
Buckley 
rejected the asserted gov­
ernment interest in regulating independent expenditures, 
concluding that “restrict[ing] the speech of some elements of 
our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others 
is wholly foreign to the First Amendment.” 424 U. S., at

Austin
’s reasoning was—and remains—inconsistent 
with 
Buckley
’s explicit repudiation of any government inter­
est in “equalizing the relative ability of individuals and 
groups to inﬂuence the outcome of elections.” 424 U. S., at 
48–49. 
Austin 
was also inconsistent with 
Bellotti
’s clear rejection 
of the idea that “speech that otherwise would be within the 
protection of the First Amendment loses that protection sim­
ply because its source is a corporation.” 435 U. S., at 784. 
The dissent correctly points out that 
Bellotti 
involved a ref­
erendum rather than a candidate election, and that 
Bellotti 
itself noted this factual distinction, 
id., 
at 788, n. 26; 
post, 
at 442–443. But this distinction does not explain why corpo­
rations may be subject to prohibitions on speech in candidate 
elections when individuals may not. 
Second, the validity of 
Austin
’s rationale—itself adopted 
over two “spirited dissents,” 
Payne, 
501 U. S., at 829—has 
proved to be the consistent subject of dispute among Mem­
bers of this Court ever since. See, 
e. g., WRTL, 
551 U. S., at 
483 (

nedy,
 
JJ.); 
Beaumont, 
539 U. S., at 163, 164 (opinions of 
Ken­
nedy
 
and 
Thomas,
 
JJ.). The simple fact that one of our 
decisions remains controversial is, of course, insufﬁcient to 
justify overruling it. But it does undermine the precedent’s 
ability to contribute to the stable and orderly development 
of the law. In such circumstances, it is entirely appropriate 
for the Court—which in this case is squarely asked to recon­
sider 
Austin
’s validity for the ﬁrst time—to address the mat­
ter with a greater w
illing
ness to consider new approaches 
capable of restoring our doctrine to sounder footing. 
Third, the 
Austin 
decision is uniquely destab
ilizing be­
cause it threatens to subvert our Court’s decisions even out­
side the particular context of corporate express advocacy.

The First Amendment theory underlying 
Austin
’s holding is 
extraordinarily broad. 
Austin
’s logic would authorize gov­
ernment prohibition of political speech by a category of 
speakers in the name of equality—a point that most scholars 
acknowledge (and many celebrate), but that the dissent de­
nies. Compare, 
e. g., 
Garrett, New Voices in Politics: Justice 
Marshall’s Jurisprudence on Law and Politics, 52 How. L. J. 
655, 669 (2009) (
Austin 
“has been understood by most com­
mentators to be an opinion driven by equality considerations, 
albeit disguised in the language of ‘political corruption’ ”), 
with 
post, 
at 464 (
Austin
’s rationale “is manifestly not just 
an ‘equalizing’ ideal in disguise”).

It should not be surprising, then, that Members of the 
Court have relied on 
Austin
’s expansive logic to justify 
greater incursions on the First Amendment, even outside the 
original context of corporate advocacy on behalf of candi­
dates running for ofﬁce. See,

electioneering speech conducted by labor unions). The dis­
sent in this case succumbs to the same temptation, sug­
gesting that 
Austin 
justiﬁes prohibiting corporate speech 
because such speech might unduly inﬂuence “the market for 
legislation.” 
Post, 
at 471. The dissent reads 
Austin 
to per­
mit restrictions on corporate speech based on nothing more 
than the fact that the corporate form may help individuals 
coordinate and present their views more effectively. 
Post, 
at 471–472. A speaker’s ability to persuade, however, pro­
vides no basis for government regulation of free and open 
public debate on what the laws should be. 
If taken seriously, 
Austin
’s logic would apply most directly 
to newspapers and other media corporations. They have a 
more profound impact on public discourse than most other 
speakers. These corporate entities are, for the time being, 
not subject to § 441b’s otherwise generally applicable prohi­
bitions on corporate political speech. But this is simply a 
matter of legislative grace. The fact that the law currently 
grants a favored position to media corporations is no rea­
son to overlook the danger inherent in accepting a theory 
that would allow government restrictions on their politi­
cal speech. See generally 
McConnell, supra, 
at 283–286 
(
Thomas,
 
J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in 
part, and dissenting in part). 
These readings of 
Austin 
do no more than carry that deci­
sion’s reasoning to its logical endpoint. In doing so, they 
highlight the threat 
Austin 
poses to First Amendment 
rights generally, even outside its speciﬁc factual context of 
corporate express advocacy. Because 
Austin 
is so difﬁcult 
to conﬁne to its facts—and because its logic threatens to un­
dermine our First Amendment jurisprudence and the nature 
of public discourse more broadly—the costs of giving it 
stare 
decisis 
effect are unusually high. 
Finally and most importantly, the Government’s own ef­
fort to defend 
Austin
—or, more accurately, to defend some­
thing that is not quite 
Austin
—underscores its weakness as

Austin 
“is not the most lucid opinion,” yet asks us to reafﬁrm 
its holding. Tr. of Oral Arg. 62 (Sept. 9, 2009). But while 
invoking 
stare decisis 
to support this position, the Govern­
ment never once even 
mentions 
the compe
lling i
nterest that 
Austin 
relied upon in the ﬁrst place: the need to diminish 
“the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggrega­
tions of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the 
corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the 
public’s support for the corporation’s political ideas.” 494 
U. 
S., at 660. 
Instead of endorsing 
Austin 
on its own terms, the Govern­
ment urges us to reafﬁrm 
Austin
’s speciﬁc holding on the 
basis of two new and potentially expansive interests—the 
need to prevent actual or apparent 
quid pro quo 
corruption, 
and the need to protect corporate shareholders. See Supp. 
Brief for Appellee 8–10, 12–13. Those interests may or may 
not support the 
result 
in 
Austin, 
but they were plainly not 
part of the 
reasoning 
on which 
Austin 
relied. 
To its credit, the Government forthrightly concedes that 
Austin 
did not embrace either of the new rationales it now 
urges upon us. See, 
e. g., 
Supp. Brief for Appellee 11 (“The 
Court did not decide in

To be clear: The Court in 
Austin 
nowhere relied upon the 
only arguments the Government now raises to support that 
decision. In fact, the only opinion in 
Austin 
endorsing the 
Government’s argument based on the threat of 
quid pro quo 
corruption was 
Justice
 
Stevens
’s concurrence. 494 U. S., 
at 678. The Court itself did not do so, despite the fact that 
the concurrence highlighted the argument. Moreover, the 
Court’s only discussion of shareholder protection in 
Austin 
appeared in a section of the opinion that sought merely to 
distinguish 
Austin
’s facts from those of 
Federal Election 
Comm’n 
v. 
Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 
479 U. S. 
238 (1986). 
Austin, supra, 
at 663. Nowhere did 
Austin 
suggest that the goal of protecting shareholders is itself a 
compe
lling i
nterest authorizing restrictions on First Amend­
ment rights. 
To the extent that the Government’s case for reafﬁrming 
Austin 
depends on radically reconceptualizing its reasoning, 
that argument is at odds with itself. 
Stare decisis 
is a doc­
trine of preservation, not transformation. It counsels defer­
ence to past mistakes, but provides no justiﬁcation for mak­
ing new ones. There is therefore no basis for the Court to 
give precedential sway to reasoning that it has never ac­
cepted, simply because that reasoning happens to support a 
conclusion reached on different grounds that have since been 
abandoned or discredited. 
Doing so would undermine the rule-of-law values that jus­
tify 
stare decisis 
in the ﬁrst place. It would effectively li­
cense the Court to invent and adopt new principles of consti­
tutional law solely for the purpose of rationalizing its past 
errors, without a proper analysis of whether those principles 
have merit on their own. This approach would allow the 
Court’s past missteps to spawn future mistakes, undercut­
ting the very rule-of-law values that 
stare decisis 
is designed 
to protect. 
None of this is to say that the Government is barred from 
making new arguments to support the outcome in 
Austin.

On the contrary, it is free to do so. And of course the Court 
is free to accept them. But the Government’s new argu­
ments must stand or fall on their own; they are not entitled 
to receive the special deference we accord to precedent. 
They are, as grounds to support 
Austin, 
literally 
un
prece­
dented. Moreover, to the extent the Government relies on 
new arguments—and declines to defend 
Austin 
on its own 
terms—we may reasonably infer that it lacks conﬁdence in 
that decision’s original justiﬁcation.

tempts this demonstration, however, in splendid isolation 
from the text of the First Amendment. It never shows why 
“the freedom of speech” that was the right of Englishmen 
did not include the freedom to speak in association with other 
individuals, including association in the corporate form. To 
be sure, in 1791 (as now) corporations could pursue only the 
objectives set forth in their charters; but the dissent pro­
vides no evidence that their speech in the pursuit of those 
objectives could be censored. 
Instead of taking this straightforward approach to deter­
mining the Amendment’s meaning, the dissent embarks on a 
detailed exploration of the Framers’ views about the “role of 
corporations in society.” 
Post, 
at 426. The Framers did not 
like corporations, the dissent concludes, and therefore it fol­
lows (as night the day) that corporations had no rights of 
free speech. Of course the Framers’ personal affection or 
disaffection for corporations is relevant only insofar as it can 
be thought to be reﬂected in the understood meaning of the 
text they enacted—not, as the dissent suggests, as a free­
standing substitute for that text. But the dissent’s distor­
tion of proper analysis is even worse than that. Though 
faced with a constitutional text that makes no distinction be­
tween types of speakers, the dissent feels no necessity to 
provide even an isolated statement from the founding era to 
the effect that corporations are 
not 
covered, but places the 
burden on appellant to bring forward statements showing

dredged up, it is far from clear that by the end of the 18th 
century corporations were despised. If so, how came there 
to be so many of them? The dissent’s statement that there 
were few business corporations during the 18th century— 
“only a few hundred during all of the 18th century”—is mis­

Moreover, what seems like a small number by today’s 
standards surely does not indicate the relative importance of 
corporations when the Nation was considerably smaller. As

Even if we thought it proper to apply the dissent’s ap­
proach of excluding from First Amendment coverage what 
the Founders disliked, and even if we agreed that the Found­
ers disliked founding-era corporations, modern corporations 
might not qualify for exclusion. Most of the Founders’ re­
sentment toward corporations was directed at the state-
granted monopoly privileges that individually chartered cor­

The dissent protests that 1791 rather than 1800 should be the relevant

Post, 
at 426, n. 53. I used 1800 
only because the dissent did. But in any case, it is surely fanciful to think 
that a consensus of hostility toward corporations was transformed into 
general favor at some magical moment between 1791 and 1796.

of our enterprising Founders—excluding, perhaps, Thomas 
Jefferson and others favoring perpetuation of an agrarian so­
ciety. Moreover, if the Founders’ speciﬁc intent with re­
spect to corporations is what matters, why does the dissent 
ignore the Founders’ views about other legal entities that 
have more in common with modern business corporations 
than the founding-era corporations? At the time of the 
founding, religious, educational, and literary corporations 
were incorporated under general incorporation statutes, 
much as business corporations are today.

Seavoy, Origins of the American Business Corporation,

unincorporated business associations, which some have ar­
gued were the “ ‘true progenitors’ ” of today’s business 
corporations. Friedman 200 (quoting S. Livermore, Early 
American Land Companies: Their Inﬂuence on Corporate 
Development 216 (1939)); see also Davis 33. Were all of 
these silently excluded from the protections of the First 
Amendment? 
The lack of a textual exception for speech by corporations 
cannot be explained on the ground that such organizations 
did not exist or did not speak. To the contrary, colleges, 
towns and cities, religious institutions, and guilds had long 
been organized as corporations at common law and under the 
King’s charter, see 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the 
Laws of England 455–473 (1765); 1 S. Kyd, A Treatise on the

At times (though not always) the dissent seems to exclude such non­
“business corporations” from its denial of free-speech rights. See 
post, 
at 428. Finding in a seemingly categorical text a distinction between the 
rights of business corporations and the rights of nonbusiness corporations 
is even more imaginative than ﬁnding a distinction between the rights of 
all 
corporations and the rights of other associations.

I have discussed, the practice of incorporation only expanded 
in the United States. Both corporations and voluntary asso­
ciations actively petitioned the Government and expressed 
their views in newspapers and pamphlets. For example: An 
antislavery Quaker corporation petitioned the First Con­
gress, distributed pamphlets, and communicated through the 
press in 1790. W. diGiacomantonio, “For the Gratiﬁcation 
of a Volunteering Society”: Antislavery and Pressure Group

German-language Press and the American Revolution, in 
The Press & the American Revolution 151, 161–162 (B. Bai­
lyn & J. Hench eds. 1980). The dissent offers no evidence— 
none whatever—that the First Amendment’s unqualiﬁed 
text was originally understood to exclude such associational 
speech from its protection.

The best the dissent can come up with is that “[p]ostratiﬁcation prac­
tice” supports its reading of the First Amendment. 
Post, 
at 431, n. 56. 
For this proposition, the dissent cites Justice White’s statement (in dis­
sent) that “[t]he common law was generally interpreted as prohibiting cor­
porate political participation,” 
First Nat. Bank of Boston 
v. 
Bellotti, 
435 
U. 
S. 765, 819 (1978). The sole authority Justice White cited for this prop­
osition, 
id., 
at 819, n. 14, was a law-review note that made no such claim. 
To the contrary, it stated that the cases dealing with the propriety of 
corporate political expenditures were “few.” Note, Corporate Political 
Affairs Programs, 70 Yale L. J. 821, 852 (1961). More speciﬁcally, the note 
cites only two holdings to that effect, one by a Federal District Court, and 
one by the Supreme Court of Montana. 
Ibid.
, n. 197. Of course even if 
the common law was “generally interpreted” to prohibit corporate political 
expenditures as ultra vires, that would have nothing to do with whether 
political expenditures that 
were 
authorized by a corporation’s charter 
could constitutionally be suppressed. 
As additional “[p]ostratiﬁcation practice,” the dissent notes that the 
Court “did not recognize 
any 
First Amendment protections for corpora­

Historical evidence relating to the textually similar clause 
“the freedom o
f... t h e 
press” also provides no support for 
the proposition that the First Amendment excludes conduct 
of artiﬁcial legal entities from the scope of its protection. 
The freedom of “the press” was widely understood to protect 
the publishing activities of individual editors and printers. 
See 
McIntyre 
v. 
Ohio Elections Comm’n, 
514 U. S. 334, 360 
(1995) (

). But these 
individuals often acted through newspapers, which (much 
like corporations) had their own names, outlived the individ­
uals who had founded them, could be bought and sold, were 
sometimes owned by more than one person, and were oper­
ated for proﬁt. See generally F. Mott, American Journal­
ism: A History of Newspapers in the United States Through 
250 Years 3–164 (1941); J. Smith, Freedom’s Fetters (1956). 
Their activities were not stripped of First Amendment pro­
tection simply because they were carried out under the ban­
ner of an artiﬁcial legal entity. And the notion which fol­
lows from the dissent’s view, that modern newspapers, since 
they are incorporated, have free-speech rights only at the

unsurprising. All of our First Amendment jurisprudence was slow to de­
velop. We did not consider application of the First Amendment to speech 
restrictions other than prior restraints until 1919, see

The dissent seeks to avoid this conclusion (and to turn a liability into 
an asset) by interpreting the Freedom of the Press Clause to refer to the 
institutional press (thus demonstrating, according to the dissent, that the 
Founders “did draw distinctions—explicit distinctions—between types of 
‘speakers,’ or speech outlets or forms”).

at 431, and n. 57. It is 
passing strange to interpret the phrase “the freedom of speech, or of the

In passing, the dissent also claims that the Court’s concep­
tion of corruption is unhistorical. The Framers “would have 
been appalled,” it says, by the evidence of corruption in the 
congressional ﬁndings supporting the Bipartisan Campaign 
Reform Act of 2002. 
Post, 
at 451–452. For this proposi­
tion, the dissent cites a law-review article arguing that “cor­
ruption” was originally understood to include “moral decay” 
and even actions taken by citizens in pursuit of private 
rather than public ends. Teachout, The Anti-Corruption 
Principle, 94 Cornell L. Rev. 341, 373, 378 (2009). It is hard 
to see how this has anything to do with what sort of corrup­
tion can be combated by restrictions on political speech. 
Moreover, if speech can be prohibited because, in the view 
of the Government, it leads to “moral decay” or does not 
serve “public ends,” then there is no limit to the Govern­
ment’s censorship power. 
The dissent says that when the Framers “constitutional­
ized the right to free speech in the First Amendment, it was 
the free speech of individual Americans that they had in 
mind.” 
Post, 
at 428. That is no doubt true. All the provi­
sions of the Bill of Rights set forth the rights of individual 
press” to mean, not everyone’s right to speak or publish, but rather every­
one’s right to speak or the institutional press’s right to publish. No one 
thought that is what it meant. Patriot Noah Webster’s 1828 dictionary 
contains, under the word “press,” the following entry: 
“
Liberty of the press, 
in civil policy, is the free right of publishing books, 
pamphlets or papers without previous restraint; or the unrestrained right 
which every citizen enjoys of publishing his thoughts and opinions, subject 
only to punishment for publishing what is pernicious to morals or to the 
peace of the state.” 2 American Dictionary of the English Language 
(1828) (reprinted 1970). 
As the Court’s opinion describes, 
ante, 
at 352, our jurisprudence agrees 
with Noah Webster and contradicts the dissent. 
“The liberty of the press is not conﬁned to newspapers and periodicals. 
It necessarily embraces pamphlets and leaﬂets. . . . The press in its histori­
cal connotation comprehends every sort of publication which affords a ve­
hicle of information and opinion.”

City of Grifﬁn,

men and women—not, for example, of trees or polar bears. 
But the individual person’s right to speak includes the right 
to speak 
in association with other individual persons. 
Surely the dissent does not believe that speech by the Re­
publican Party or the Democratic Party can be censored be­
cause it is not the speech of “an individual American.” It is 
the speech of many individual Americans, who have associ­
ated in a common cause, giving the leadership of the party 
the right to speak on their behalf. The association of indi­
viduals in a business corporation is no different—or at least 
it cannot be denied the right to speak on the simplistic 
ground that it is not “an individual American.” 
7 
But to return to, and summarize, my principal point, which 
is the conformity of today’s opinion with the original mean­
ing of the First Amendment. The Amendment is written in 
terms of “speech,” not speakers. Its text offers no foothold 
7 
The dissent says that “ ‘speech’ ” refers to oral communications of 
human beings, and since corporations are not human beings they cannot 
speak. 
Post, 
at 428, n. 55. This is sophistry. The authorized spokesman 
of a corporation is a human being, who speaks on behalf of the human 
beings who have formed that association—just as the spokesman of an 
unincorporated association speaks on behalf of its members. The power 
to publish thoughts, no less than the power to speak thoughts, belongs 
only to human beings, but the dissent sees no problem with a corporation’s 
enjoying the freedom of the press. 
The same footnote asserts that “it has been ‘claimed that the notion of 
institutional speech . . . did not exist in post-revolutionary America.’ ” 
This is quoted from a law-review article by a Bigelow Fellow at the Uni­
versity of Chicago (Fagundes, State Actors as First Amendment Speakers, 
100 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1637, 1654 (2006)), which offers as the sole support for 
its statement a treatise dealing with government speech, M. Yudof, When 
Government Speaks 42–50 (1983). The cited pages of that treatise pro­
vide no support whatever for the statement—unless, as seems overwhelm­
ingly likely, the “institutional speech” referred to was speech by the 
subject of the law-review article, governmental institutions. 
The other authority cited in the footnote, a law-review article by a pro­
fessor at Washington and Lee Law School, Bezanson, Institutional Speech, 
80 Iowa L. Rev. 735, 775 (1995), in fact contradicts the dissent, in that it 
would accord free-speech protection to associations.

for excluding any category of speaker, from single individu­
als to partnerships of individuals, to unincorporated associa­
tions of individuals, to incorporated associations of individu­
als—and the dissent offers no evidence about the original 
meaning of the text to support any such exclusion. We are 
therefore simply left with the question whether the speech 
at issue in this case is “speech” covered by the First Amend­
ment. No one says otherwise. A documentary ﬁlm critical 
of a potential Presidential candidate is core political speech, 
and its nature as such does not change simply because it 
was funded by a corporation. Nor does the character of that 
funding produce any reduction whatever in the “inherent 
worth of the speech” and “its capacity for informing the pub­
lic,” 
First Nat. Bank of Boston 
v. 
Bellotti, 
435 U. S. 765, 777 
(1978). Indeed, to exclude or impede corporate speech is to 
muzzle the principal agents of the modern free economy. 
We should celebrate rather than condemn the addition of this 
speech to the public debate.

The real issue in this case concerns how, not if, the appel­
lant may ﬁnance its electioneering. Citizens United is a 
wealthy nonproﬁt corporation that runs a political action 
committee (PAC) with m
illions of dol
lars in assets. Under 
the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), it 
could have used those assets to televise and promote 
Hil­
lary: The Movie 
wherever and whenever it wanted to. It 
also could have spent unrestricted sums to broadcast 
Hillary 
at any time other than the 30 days before the last primary 
election. Neither Citizens United’s nor any other corpora­
tion’s speech has been “banned,” 
ante, 
at 319. All that the 
parties dispute is whether Citizens United had a right to use 
the funds in its general treasury to pay for broadcasts during 
the 30-day period. The notion that the First Amendment 

394 CITIZENS UNITED 
v.

Opinion of 
Stevens,

dictates an afﬁrmative answer to that question is, in my 
judgment, profoundly misguided. Even more misguided is 
the notion that the Court must rewrite the law relating to 
campaign expenditures by 
for-proﬁt 
corporations and unions 
to decide this case. 
The basic premise underlying the Court’s ruling is its iter­
ation, and constant reiteration, of the proposition that the 
First Amendment bars regulatory distinctions based on a 
speaker’s identity, including its “identity” as a corporation. 
While that glittering generality has rhetorical appeal, it is 
not a correct statement of the law. Nor does it tell us when 
a corporation may engage in electioneering that some of its 
shareholders oppose. It does not even resolve the speciﬁc 
question whether Citizens United may be required to ﬁnance 
some of its messages with the money in its PAC. The con­
ceit that corporations must be treated identically to natural 
persons in the political sphere is not only inaccurate but also 
inadequate to justify the Court’s disposition of this case. 
In the context of election to public ofﬁce, the distinction 
between corporate and human speakers is signiﬁcant. Al­
though they make enormous contributions to our society, cor­
porations are not actually members of it. They cannot vote 
or run for ofﬁce. Because they may be managed and con­
trolled by nonresidents, their interests may conﬂict in funda­
mental respects with the interests of eligible voters. The 
ﬁnancial resources, legal structure, and instrumental orien­
tation of corporations raise legitimate concerns about their 
role in the electoral process. Our lawmakers have a compel­
ling constitutional basis, if not also a democratic duty, to take 
measures designed to guard against the potentially deleteri­
ous effects of corporate spending in local and national races. 
The majority’s approach to corporate electioneering marks 
a dramatic break from our past. Congress has placed spe­
cial limitations on campaign spending by corporations ever 
since the passage of the Tillman Act in 1907, ch. 420, 34 Stat. 
864.

The Court’s ruling threatens to undermine the integrity of 
elected institutions across the Nation. The path it has 
taken to reach its outcome will, I fear, do damage to this 
institution. Before turning to the question whether to over­
rule 
Austin 
and part of 
McConnell, 
it is important to explain 
why the Court should not be deciding that question. 
Scope of the Case 
The ﬁrst reason is that the question was not properly 
brought before us. In declaring § 203 of BCRA facially un­
constitutional on the ground that corporations’ electoral ex­
penditures may not be regulated any more stringently than 
those of individuals, the majority decides this case on a basis 
relinquished below, not included in the questions presented 
to us by the litigants, and argued here only in response to 
the Court’s invitation. This procedure is unusual and inad­
visable for a court.

asked to reconsider 
Austin

zens United expressly abandoned its facial challenge, 1:07–

Austin, 
the key case the majority

the facial challenge to § 203 that it previously agreed to dis­
miss. In fact, not one of those questions raised an issue 
based on Citizens United’s corporate status. Juris. State­
ment (i). Moreover, even in its merits brieﬁng, when Citi­
zens United injected its request to overrule 
Austin, 
it never

The majority states that, in denying Citizens United’s motion for a 
preliminary injunction, the District Court “addressed” the facial validity 
of BCRA § 203. 
Ante, 
at 330. That is true, in the narrow sense that the 
court observed the issue was foreclosed by 
McConnell

FEC, 
540 U. S.

(per curiam). 
Yet as 
explained above, Citizens United subsequently dismissed its facial chal­
lenge, so that by the time the District Court granted the Federal Election 
Commission’s (FEC) motion for summary judgment, App. 261a–262a, any 
question about statutory validity had dropped out of the case. That latter 
ruling by the District Court was the “ﬁnal decision” from which Citizens 
United appealed to this Court under BCRA § 403(a)(3). As regards the 
lower court decision that has come before us, the claim that § 203 is facially 
unconstitutional was neither pressed nor passed upon in any form.

for the mention of any. That is unsurprising, for none 
exists. 
Setting the case for reargument was a constructive step,

As-Applied and Facial Challenges 
This Court has repeatedly emphasized in recent years 
that “[f]acial challenges are disfavored.”

rule’ is that ‘partial, rather than facial, invalidation is the 
required course,’ such that a ‘statute may

§ 203 facially unconstitutional, our colleagues have turned an 
as-applied challenge into a facial challenge, in deﬁance of 
this principle. 
This is not merely a technical defect in the Court’s deci­
sion. The unnecessary resort to a facial inquiry “run[s] con­

trary to the fundamental principle of judicial restraint that 
courts should neither anticipate a question of constitutional 
law in advance of the necessity of deciding it nor formulate 
a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the 
precise facts to which it is to be applied.” 
Washington State 
Grange, 
552 U. S., at 450 (internal quotation marks omitted). 
Scanting that principle “threaten[s] to short circuit the dem­
ocratic process by preventing laws embodying the will of the 
people from being implemented in a manner consistent with 
the Constitution.” 
Id., 
at 451. These concerns are height­
ened when judges overrule settled doctrine upon which the 
legislature has relied. The Court operates with a sledge 
hammer rather than a scalpel when it strikes down one of 
Congress’ most signiﬁcant efforts to regulate the role that 
corporations and unions play in electoral politics. It com­
pounds the offense by implicitly striking down a great many 
state laws as well. 
The problem goes still deeper, for the Court does all of 
this on the basis of pure speculation. Had Citizens United 
maintained a facial challenge, and thus argued that there 
are virtually no circumstances in which BCRA § 203 can be 
applied constitutionally, the parties could have developed, 
through the normal process of litigation, a record about the 
actual 
effects of § 203, its actual burdens and its actual bene­
ﬁts, on 
all 
manner of corporations and unions.

“Claims of 
facial invalidity often rest on speculation,” and consequently 
“raise the risk of premature interpretation of statutes on the

Shortly before Citizens United mooted the issue by abandoning its fa­
cial challenge, the Government advised the District Court that it “re­
quire[d] time to develop a factual record regarding [the] facial challenge.” 
1:07–cv–2240–RCL–RWR, Docket Entry No. 47, p. 4 (Mar. 26, 2008). By 
reinstating a claim that Citizens United abandoned, the Court gives it 
a perverse litigating advantage over its adversary, which was deprived 
of the opportunity to gather and present information necessary to its 
rebuttal.

basis of factually barebones records.” 
Id., 
at 450 (internal 
quotation marks omitted). In this case, the record is not 
simply incomplete or unsatisfactory; it is nonexistent. Con­
gress crafted BCRA in response to a virtual mountain of 
research on the corruption that previous legislation had 
failed to avert. The Court now negates Congress’ efforts 
without a shred of evidence on how § 203 or its state-law 
counterparts have been affecting any entity other than Citi­
zens United.
5 
Faced with this gaping empirical hole, the majority throws 
up its hands. Were we to conﬁne our inquiry to Citizens 
United’s as-applied challenge, it protests, we would com­
mence an “extended” process of “draw[ing], and then re­
draw[ing], constitutional lines based on the particular media 
or technology used to disseminate political speech from a 
particular speaker.” 
Ante, 
at 326. While tacitly acknowl­
edging that some applications of § 203 might be found consti­
tutional, the majority thus posits a future in which novel 
First Amendment standards must be devised on an ad hoc 
basis, and then leaps from this unfounded prediction to the 
unfounded conclusion that such complexity counsels the 
abandonment of all normal restraint. Yet it is a pervasive 
5 
In fact, we do not even have a good evidentiary record of how § 203 
has been affecting Citizens United, which never submitted to the District 
Court the details of 
Hillary
’s funding or its own ﬁnances. We likewise 
have no evidence of how § 203 and comparable state laws were expected 
to affect corporations and unions in the future. 
It is true, as the majority points out, that the 
McConnell 
Court evalu­
ated the facial validity of § 203 in light of an extensive record. See 
ante, 
at 331–332. But that record is not before us in this case. And in any 
event, the majority’s argument for striking down § 203 depends on its con­
tention that the statute has proved too “c
hilling” in 
practice—and in par­
ticular on the contention that the controlling opinion in 
WRTL, 
551 U. S. 
449 (2007), failed to bring sufﬁcient clarity and “breathing space” to this 
area of law. See 
ante, 
at 329, 333–336. We have no record with which 
to assess that claim. The Court complains at length about the burdens of 
complying with § 203, but we have no meaningful evidence to show how 
regulated corporations and unions have experienced its restrictions.

feature of regulatory systems that unanticipated events, 
such as new technologies, may raise some unanticipated dif­
ﬁculties at the margins. The ﬂuid nature of electioneering 
communications does not make this case special. The fact 
that a Court can hypothesize situations in which a statute 
might, at some point down the line, pose some unforeseen 
as-applied problems, does not come close to meeting the 
standard for a facial challenge.
6 
The majority proposes several other justiﬁcations for the 
sweep of its ruling. It suggests that a facial ruling is neces­
sary because, if the Court were to continue on its normal 
course of resolving as-applied challenges as they present 
themselves, that process would itself run afoul of the First 
Amendment. See, 
e. g., ante, 
at 326 (as-applied review proc­
ess “would raise questions as to the courts’ own lawful au­
thority”); 
ibid. 
(“Courts, too, are bound by the First Amend­
ment”). This suggestion is perplexing. Our colleagues 
elsewhere trumpet “our duty ‘to say what the law is,’ ” even 
when our predecessors on the bench and our counterparts in 
Congress have interpreted the law differently. 
Ante, 
at 365 
(quoting 
Marbury 
v. 
Madison, 
1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803)). 
We do not typically say what the law 
is not 
as a hedge 
against future judicial error. The possibility that later 
courts will misapply a constitutional provision does not give

Our cases recognize a “type of facial challenge in the First Amendment 
context under which a law may be overturned as impermissibly overbroad 
because a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional.” 
Washington State Grange 
v. 
Washington State Republican Party, 
552 
U. 
S. 442, 449, n. 6 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). Citizens 
United has not made an overbreadth argument, and “[w]e generally do not 
apply the strong medicine of overbreadth analysis where the parties fail 
to describe the instances of arguable overbreadth of the contested law,” 
ibid. 
(internal quotation marks omitted). If our colleagues nonetheless 
concluded that § 203’s fatal ﬂaw is that it affects too much protected 
speech, they should have invalidated it for overbreadth and given guidance 
as to which applications are permissible, so that Congress could go about 
repairing the error.

us a basis for pretermitting litigation relating to that 
provision.
7 
The majority suggests that a facial ruling is necessary be­
cause anything less would chill too much protected speech. 
See 
ante, 
at 326–327, 329, 333–336. In addition to begging 
the question what types of corporate spending are constitu­
tionally protected and to what extent, this claim rests on the 
assertion that some signiﬁcant number of corporations have 
been cowed into quiescence by FEC “ ‘censor[ship].’ ” 
Ante, 
at 335. That assertion is unsubstantiated, and it is hard to 
square with practical experience. It is particularly hard to 
square with the legal landscape following 
WRTL, 
which held 
that a corporate communication could be regulated under 
§ 203 only if it was “susceptible of 
no 
reasonable interpreta­
tion other than as an appeal to vote for or against a speciﬁc 
candidate.” 551 U. S., at 470 (opinion of 
Roberts,
 
C. J.) (em­
phasis added). The whole point of this test was to make 
§ 203 as simple and speech-protective as possible. The 
Court does not explain how, in the span of a single election 
cycle, it has determined 
The
 
Chief
 
Justice
’s project to be 
a failure. In this respect, too, the majority’s critique of 
line-drawing collapses into a critique of the as-applied review 
method generally.
8 
7 
Also perplexing is the majority’s attempt to pass blame to the Govern­
ment for its litigating position. By “hold[ing] out the possibility of ruling 
for Citizens United on a narrow ground yet refrain[ing] from adopting that 
position,” the majority says, the Government has caused “added uncer­
tainty [that] demonstrates the necessity to address the question of statu­
tory validity.” 
Ante, 
at 333. Our colleagues have apparently never heard 
of an alternative argument. Like every litigant, the Government would 
prefer to win its case outright; failing that, it would prefer to lose on a 
narrow ground. The fact that there are numerous different ways this 
case could be decided, and that the Government acknowledges as much, 
does not demonstrate anything about the propriety of a facial ruling. 
8
The majority’s “c
hilling” arg
ument is particularly inapposite with re­
spect to 2 U. S. C. § 441b’s longstanding restriction on the use of corporate 
general treasury funds for express advocacy. If there was ever any sig­
niﬁcant uncertainty about what counts as the functional equivalent of ex­

Opinion of 
Stevens,
 
J .
 
The majority suggests that, even though it expressly dis­
missed its facial challenge, Citizens United nevertheless pre­
served it—not as a freestanding “claim,” but as a potential 
argument in support of “a claim that the FEC has violated 
its First Amendment right to free speech.” 
Ante, 
at 330; 
see also 
ante, 
at 376 (
Roberts,
 
C.
 
J.,
 
concurring) (describing 
Citizens United’s claim as: “[T]he Act violates the First 
Amendment”). By this novel logic, virtually any submission 
could be reconceptualized as “a claim that the Government 
has violated my rights,” and it would then be available to 
the Court to entertain any conceivable issue that might be 
relevant to that claim’s disposition. Not only the as-applied/ 
facial distinction, but the basic relationship between litigants 
and courts, would be upended if the latter had free rein to 
construe the former’s claims at such high levels of generality. 
There would be no need for plaintiffs to argue their case; 
they could just cite the constitutional provisions they think 
relevant, and leave the rest to us.
9 
Finally, the majority suggests that though the scope of Cit­
izens United’s claim may be narrow, a facial ruling is neces­
sary as a matter of remedy. Relying on a law review article, 
it asserts that Citizens United’s dismissal of the facial chal­
lenge does not prevent us “ ‘from making broader pronounce­
ments of invalidity in properly “as-applied” cases.’ ” 
Ante, 
at 331 (quoting Fallon, As-Applied and Facial Challenges and 
press advocacy, there has been little doubt about what counts as express 
advocacy since the “magic words” test of 
Buckley 
v. 
Valeo, 
424 U. S. 1, 44, 
n. 
52 (1976) 
(per curiam). 
Yet even though Citizens United’s briefs never 
once mention § 441b’s restriction on express advocacy; even though this 
restriction does not generate c
hilling 
concerns; and even though no one 
has suggested that 
Hillary 
counts as express advocacy; the majority none­
theless reaches out to opine that this statutory provision is “invalid” as 
well. 
Ante, 
at 365. 
9 
The majority adds that the distinction between facial and as-applied 
challenges does not have “some automatic effect” that mechanically con­
trols the judicial task. 
Ante, 
at 331. I agree, but it does not follow that 
in any given case we should ignore the distinction, much less invert it.

claim a ‘facial’ or ‘as-applied’ challenge, the consequences of 
the Court’s decision are the same”). The majority is on 
ﬁrmer conceptual ground here. Yet even if one accepts this 
part of Professor Fallon’s thesis, one must proceed to ask 
which 
as-applied challenges, if successful, will “properly” in­
vite or entail invalidation of the underlying statute.
10 
The 
paradigmatic case is a judicial determination that the legis­
lature acted with an impermissible purpose in enacting a 
provision, as this carries the necessary implication that all 
future as-applied challenges to the provision must prevail. 
See Fallon 1339–1340. 
Citizens United’s as-applied challenge was not of this sort. 
Until this Court ordered reargument, its contention was that 
BCRA § 203 could not lawfully be applied to a feature-length 
video-on-demand ﬁlm (such as 
Hillary
) or to a nonproﬁt cor­
poration exempt from taxation under 26 U. S. C. § 501(c)(4)
11 
and funded overwhelmingly by individuals (such as itself).

claims would not necessarily carry any implications for the

Gonzales 
v.

and “[f]or this reason, ‘[a]s-applied challenges are the basic building blocks

types of corporations, or unions. It certainly would not in­
validate the statute as applied to a large for-proﬁt corpora­
tion. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 8, 4 (Mar. 24, 2009) (counsel for 
Citizens United emphasizing that appellant is “a small, non­
proﬁt organization, which is very much like [an

corpo­
ration],” and afﬁrming that its argument “deﬁnitely would

Hillary 
were distributed by General Mo­

12 
There is no legitimate basis for resurrecting a facial 
challenge that dropped out of this case 20 months ago. 
Narrower Grounds 
It is all the more distressing that our colleagues have man­
ufactured a facial challenge, because the parties have ad­
vanced numerous ways to resolve the case that would facili­
tate electioneering by nonproﬁt advocacy corporations such 
as Citizens United, without toppling statutes and precedents. 
Which is to say, the majority has transgressed yet another 
“cardinal” principle of the judicial process: “[I]f it is not nec­
essary to decide more, it is necessary not to decide more,” 
PDK Labs. Inc. 
v. 
Drug Enforcement Admin., 
362 F. 3d 786, 
12 
The
 
Chief
 
Justice
 
is therefore much too quick when he suggests 
that, “[e]ven if considered in as-applied terms, a holding in this case that 
the Act may not be applied to Citizens United—because corporations as 
well as individuals enjoy the pertinent First Amendment rights—would 
mean that any other corporation raising the same challenge would also 
win.” 
Ante, 
at 376 (concurring opinion). That conclusion would only fol­
low if the Court were to ignore Citizens United’s plausible as-applied argu­
ments and instead take the implausible position that 
all 
corporations and 
all 
types of expenditures enjoy the same First Amendment protections, 
which 
always 
trump the interests in regulation. At times, the majority 
appears to endorse this extreme view. At other times, however, it ap­
pears to suggest that nonproﬁt corporations have a better claim to First 
Amendment protection than for-proﬁt corporations, see 
ante, 
at 337, 355, 
“advocacy” organizations have a better claim than other nonproﬁts,

rations,

national business corporation in its hypotheticals.

v. 
FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N 
Opinion of 
Stevens,
 
J .
 
799 (CADC 2004) (Roberts, J., concurring in part and concur­
ring in judgment). 
Consider just three of the narrower grounds of decision 
that the majority has bypassed. First, the Court could have 
ruled, on statutory grounds, that a feature-length ﬁlm 
distributed through video-on-demand does not qualify as 
an “electioneering communication” under § 203 of BCRA, 
2 U. S. C. § 441b. BCRA deﬁnes that term to encompass 
certain communications transmitted by “broadcast, cable, or 
satellite.” § 434(f)(3)(A). When Congress was developing 
BCRA, the video-on-demand medium was still in its infancy, 
and legislators were focused on a very different sort of pro­
gramming: short advertisements run on television or radio. 
See 
McConnell, 
540 U. S., at 207. The sponsors of BCRA 
acknowledge that the FEC’s implementing regulations do 
not clearly apply to video-on-demand transmissions. See 
Brief for Senator John McCain et al. as 
Amici Curiae 
17–18. 
In light of this ambiguity, the distinctive characteristics of 
video-on-demand, and “[t]he elementary rule . . . that every 
reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to save 
a statute from unconstitutionality,” 
Hooper 
v. 
California, 
155 U. S. 648, 657 (1895), the Court could have reasonably 
ruled that § 203 does not apply to 
Hillary.
13 
Second, the Court could have expanded the 
MCFL 
exemp­
tion to cover § 501(c)(4) nonproﬁts that accept only a 
de mini-
mis 
amount of money from for-proﬁt corporations. Citizens 
United professes to be such a group: Its brief says it “is 
funded predominantly by donations from individuals who 
support [its] ideological message.” Brief for Appellant 5. 
Numerous Courts of Appeals have held that

business support does not, in itself, remove an otherwise

qualifying organization from the ambit of 
MCFL.
14 
This 
Court could have simply followed their lead.
15 
Finally, let us not forget Citizens United’s as-applied 
constitutional challenge. Precisely because Citizens United 
looks so much like the 
MCFL 
organizations we have ex­
empted from regulation, while a feature-length video-on­
demand ﬁlm looks so unlike the types of electoral advocacy 
Congress has found deserving of regulation, this challenge is 
a substantial one. As the appellant’s own arguments show, 
the Court could have easily limited the breadth of its consti­
tutional holding had it declined to adopt the novel notion that 
speakers and speech acts must always be treated identi­
cally—and always spared expenditures restrictions—in the 
political realm. Yet the Court nonetheless turns its back on 
the as-applied review process that has been a staple of cam­
paign ﬁnance litigation since 
Buckley 
v. 
Valeo, 
424 U. S. 1 
14 
See 
Colorado Right to Life Comm., Inc. 
v. 
Coffman, 
498 F. 3d 1137, 
1148 (CA10 2007) (adopting this rule and noting that “every other circuit 
to have addressed this issue” has done likewise); Brief for Independent 
Sector as 
Amicus Curiae 
10–11 (collecting cases). The Court rejects this 
solution in part because the Government “merely suggest[s] it” and “does 
not say that it agrees with the interpretation.” 
Ante, 
at 328, 329. Our 
colleagues would thus punish a defendant for showing insufﬁcient excite­
ment about a ground it has advanced, at the same time that they decide 
the case on a ground the plaintiff expressly abandoned. The Court also 
protests that a 
de minimis 
standard would “requir[e] intricate case-by­
case determinations.” 
Ante, 
at 329. But 
de minimis 
tests need not be 
intricate at all. A test that granted 
MCFL 
status to § 501(c)(4) organiza­
tions if they received less than a ﬁxed dollar amount of business donations 
in the previous year, or if such donations represent less than a ﬁxed per­
centage of their total assets, would be perfectly easy to understand and 
administer. 
15 
Another bypassed ground, not briefed by the parties, would have been 
to revive the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment in BCRA § 203(c), allowing cer­
tain nonproﬁt corporations to pay for electioneering communications with 
general treasury funds, to the extent they can trace the payments to indi­
vidual contributions. See Brief for National Riﬂe Association as

trict Court, or adopting a narrower ground that would retain 
Austin, 
is its disdain for 
Austin. 
II 
The ﬁnal principle of judicial process that the majority vio­
lates is the most transparent: 
stare decisis. 
I am not an ab­
solutist when it comes to 
stare decisis, 
in the campaign ﬁ­
nance area or in any other. No one is. But if this principle 
is to do any meaningful work in supporting the rule of law, 
it must at least demand a signiﬁcant justiﬁcation, beyond the 
preferences of ﬁve Justices, for overturning settled doctrine. 
“[A] decision to overrule should rest on some special reason 
16 
The
 
Chief
 
Justice
 
ﬁnds our discussion of these narrower solutions 
“quite perplexing” because we suggest that the Court should “latch on to 
one of them in order to avoid reaching the broader constitutional ques­
tion,” without doing the same ourselves. 
Ante, 
at 375. There is nothing 
perplexing about the matter, because we are not similarly situated to our 
colleagues in the majority. We do not share their view of the First 
Amendment. Our reading of the Constitution would not lead us to strike 
down any statutes or overturn any precedents in this case, and we there­
fore have no occasion to practice constitutional avoidance or to vindicate 
Citizens United’s as-applied challenge. Each of the arguments made 
above is surely at least as strong as the statutory argument the Court 
accepted in last year’s Voting Rights Act case, 
Northwest Austin Munici­
pal Util. Dist. No. One

557 U. S. 193 (2009).

over and above the belief that a prior case was wrongly de­
cided.” 
Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. 
v. 
Casey, 
505 U. S. 833, 864 (1992). No such justiﬁcation exists in this 
case, and to the contrary there are powerful prudential rea­
sons to keep faith with our precedents.
17 
The Court’s central argument for why 
stare decisis 
ought 
to be trumped is that it does not like 
Austin. 
The opin­
ion “was not well reasoned,” our colleagues assert, and it 
conﬂicts with First Amendment principles. 
Ante, 
at 363. 
This, of course, is the Court’s merits argument, the many 
defects in which we will soon consider. I am perfectly will­
ing to concede that if one of our precedents were dead wrong 
in its reasoning or irreconcilable with the rest of our doc­
trine, there would be a compe
lling 
basis for revisiting it. 
But neither is true of 
Austin, 
as I explain at length in Parts 
III and IV , 
infra, 
at 414–478, and restating a merits argu­
ment with additional vigor does not give it extra weight in 
the 
stare decisis 
calculus. 
Perhaps in recognition of this point, the Court supple­
ments its merits case with a smattering of assertions. The 
Court proclaims that “
Austin 
is undermined by experience 
since its announcement.” 
Ante, 
at 364. This is a curious 
claim to make in a case that lacks a developed record. The 
majority has no empirical evidence with which to substanti­
ate the claim; we just have its 
ipse dixit 
that the real world 
has not been kind to 
Austin. 
Nor does the majority bother 
to specify in what sense 
Austin 
has been “undermined.” In­
stead it treats the reader to a string of non sequiturs: “Our 
Nation’s speech dynamic is changing,” 
ante, 
at 364; “[s]peak­
ers have become adept at presenting citizens with sound 
bites, talking points, and scripted messages,” 
ibid.; 
“[c]orpo­
ration
s...d on o t 
have monolithic views,” 
ibid. 
How any 
17 
I will 
have more to say shortly about the merits—about why 
Austin 
and 
McConnell 
are not doctrinal outliers, as the Court contends, and why 
their logic is not only defensible but also compelling. For present pur­
poses, I limit the discussion to 
stare
-
decisis
-speciﬁc considerations.

of these ruminations weakens the force of 
stare decisis 
es­
capes my comprehension.
18 
The majority also contends that the Government’s hesi­
tation to rely on 
Austin
’s antidistortion rationale “dimin­
ishe[s]” “the principle of adhering to that precedent.” 
Ante, 
at 363; see also 
ante, 
at 382 (opinion of 
Roberts,
 
C. J.) (Gov­
ernment’s litigating position is “most importan[t]” factor un­
dermining 
Austin
). Why it diminishes the value of 
stare 
decisis 
is left unexplained. We have never thought ﬁt to 
overrule a precedent because a litigant has taken any partic­
ular tack. Nor should we. Our decisions can often be de­
fended on multiple grounds, and a litigant may have strategic 
or case-speciﬁc reasons for emphasizing only a subset of 
them. Members of the public, moreover, often rely on our 
bottom-line holdings far more than our precise legal argu­
ments; surely this is true for the legislatures that have been 
regulating corporate electioneering since 
Austin. 
The task 
of evaluating the continued viability of precedents falls to 
this Court, not to the parties.
19 
18 
The
 
Chief
 
Justice
 
suggests that 
Austin 
has been undermined by 
subsequent dissenting opinions. 
Ante, 
at 380. Under this view, it ap­
pears that the more times the Court stands by a precedent in the face of 
requests to overrule it, the weaker that precedent becomes. 
The
 
Chief
 
Justice
 
further suggests that 
Austin 
“is uniquely destabilizing because 
it threatens to subvert our Court’s decisions even outside” its particular 
facts, as when we applied its reasoning in 
McConnell. Ante, 
at 380. 
Once again, the theory seems to be that the more we utilize a precedent, 
the more we call it into question. For those who believe 
Austin 
was 
correctly decided—as the Federal Government and the States have long 
believed, as the majority of Justices to have served on the Court since 
Austin 
have believed, and as we continue to believe—there is nothing 
“destabilizing” about the prospect of its continued application. It is gut­
ting campaign ﬁnance laws across the country, as the Court does today, 
that 
will be 
destabilizing. 
19 
Additionally, the majority cites some recent scholarship challenging 
the historical account of campaign ﬁnance law given in 
United States 
v. 
Automobile Workers, 
352 U. S. 567 (1957). 
Ante, 
at 363–364.

Although the majority opinion spends several pages mak­
ing these surprising arguments, it says almost nothing about 
the standard considerations we have used to determine 
stare 
decisis 
value, such as the antiquity of the precedent, the 
workability of its legal rule, and the reliance interests at 
stake. It is also conspicuously silent about 
McConnell, 
even 
though the 
McConnell 
Court’s decision to uphold BCRA 
§ 203 relied not only on the antidistortion logic of 
Austin 
but 
also on the statute’s historical pedigree, see, 
e. g., 
540 U. S., 
at 115–132, 223–224, and the need to preserve the integrity 
of federal campaigns, see 
id., 
at 126–129, 205–208, and n. 88. 
We have recognized that “
[s]tare decisis 
has special force 
when legislators or citizens ‘have acted in reliance on a previ­
ous decision, for in this instance overruling the decision 
would dislodge settled rights and expectations or require an 
extensive legislative response.’ ” 
Hubbard 
v. 
United States, 
514 U. S. 695, 714 (1995) (plurality opinion) (quoting 
Hilton 
v. 
South Carolina Public Railways Comm’n, 
502 U. S. 197, 
202 (1991)). 
Stare decisis 
protects not only personal rights 
involving property or contract but also the ability of the 
elected branches to shape their laws in an effective and co­
herent fashion. Today’s decision takes away a power that 
we have long permitted these branches to exercise. State 
legislatures have relied on their authority to regulate corpo­
rate electioneering, conﬁrmed in 
Austin, 
for more than a 
century.
20 
The Federal Congress has relied on this author­
ity for a comparable stretch of time, and it speciﬁcally relied 
on 
Austin 
throughout the years it spent developing and de­
if the scholarship cited by the majority is correct that certain campaign 
ﬁnance reforms were less deliberate or less benignly motivated than 
Auto­
mobile Workers 
suggested, the point remains that this body of law has 
played a signiﬁcant and broadly accepted role in American political life for 
decades upon decades.

long.
21 
Pulling out the rug 
beneath Congress after 
afﬁrming the constitutionality of § 203 six years ago shows 
great disrespect for a coequal branch. 
By removing one of its central components, today’s ruling 
makes a hash out of BCRA’s “delicate and interconnected 
regulatory scheme.” 
McConnell, 
540 U. S., at 172. Con­
sider just one example of the distortions that will follow: 
Political parties are barred under BCRA from soliciting or 
spending “soft money,” funds that are not subject to the stat­
ute’s disclosure requirements or its source and amount limi­
tations. 2 U. S. C. § 441i; 
McConnell, 
540 U. S., at 122–126. 
Going forward, corporations and unions will be free to spend 
as much general treasury money as they wish on ads that 
support or attack speciﬁc candidates, whereas national par­
ties will not be able to spend a dime of soft money on ads of 
any kind. The Court’s ruling thus dramatically enhances 
the role of corporations and unions—and the narrow inter­
ests they represent—vis-a
`
-vis the role of political parties— 
and the broad coalitions they represent—in determining who 
will hold public ofﬁce.
22 
Beyond the reliance interests at stake, the other 
stare de­
cisis 
factors also cut against the Court. Considerations of 
antiquity are signiﬁcant for similar reasons. 
McConnell 
is 
only six years old, but 
Austin 
has been on the books for two 
decades, and many of the statutes called into question by 
today’s opinion have been on the books for a half century or 
more. The Court points to no intervening change in circum­
stances that warrants revisiting 
Austin. 
Certainly nothing

McConnell v. FEC,

tion L. J. 285 (2004). 
22 
To be sure, the majority may respond that Congress can correct the 
imbalance by removing BCRA’s soft-money limits. Cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. 
24 (Sept. 9, 2009) (query of 
Kennedy ,
 
J.). But this is no response to any 
legislature that takes campaign ﬁnance regulation seriously. It merely 
illustrates the breadth of the majority’s deregulatory vision.

relevant has changed since we decided 
WRTL 
two Terms 
ago. And the Court gives no reason to think that 
Austin 
and 
McConnell 
are unworkable. 
In fact, no one has argued to us that 
Austin
’s rule has 
proved impracticable, and not a single for-proﬁt corporation, 
union, or State has asked us to overrule it. Quite to the 
contrary, leading groups representing the business commu­
nity,
23 
organized labor,
24 
and the nonproﬁt sector,
25 
together 
with more than half of the States,
26 
urge that we preserve 
Austin. 
As for 
McConnell, 
the portions of BCRA it upheld 
may be prolix, but all three branches of Government have 
worked to make § 203 as user-friendly as possible. For in­
stance, Congress established a special mechanism for expe­
dited review of constitutional challenges, see note following 
2 U. S. C. § 437h; the FEC has established a standardized 
process, with clearly deﬁned safe harbors, for corporations 
to claim that a particular electioneering communication is 
permissible under 
WRTL,

United States,

28 
In the end, the Court’s rejection of 
Austin 
and 
McConnell 
comes down to nothing more than its disagreement with 
their results. Virtually every one of its arguments was 
made and rejected in those cases, and the majority opinion 
is essentially an amalgamation of resuscitated dissents. The 
only relevant thing that has changed since 
Austin 
and 
Mc­
Connell 
is the composition of this Court. Today’s ruling 
thus strikes at the vitals of 
stare decisis, 
“the means by 
which we ensure that the law will not merely change errati­
cally, but will develop in a principled and intelligible fashion” 
that “permits society to presume that bedrock principles are 
founded in the law rather than in the proclivities of individu­
als.”

Hillery, 
474 U. S. 254, 265 (1986). 
III 
The novelty of the Court’s procedural dereliction and its 
approach to 
stare decisis 
is matched by the novelty of its 
ruling on the merits. The ruling rests on several premises. 
First, the Court claims that 
Austin 
and 
McConnell 
have 
“banned” corporate speech. Second, it claims that the First 
Amendment precludes regulatory distinctions based on 
speaker identity, including the speaker’s identity as a corpo­
28 
Concededly, 
Austin 
and 
McConnell 
were constitutional decisions, and 
we have often said that “claims of 
stare decisis 
are at their weakest in 
that ﬁeld, where our mistakes cannot be corrected by Congress.” 
Vieth 
v. 
Jubelirer, 
541 U. S. 267, 305 (2004) (plurality opinion). As a general 
matter, this principle is a sound one. But the principle only takes on real 
force when an earlier ruling has obstructed the normal democratic proc­
ess; it is the fear of making “mistakes [that] cannot be corrected by Con­
gress,” 
ibid., 
that motivates us to review constitutional precedents with a 
more critical eye. 
Austin 
and 
McConnell 
did not obstruct state or con­
gressional legislative power in any way. Although it is unclear how high 
a bar today’s decision 
will 
pose to future attempts to regulate corporate 
electioneering, it 
will 
clearly restrain much legislative action.

ration. Third, it claims that 
Austin 
and 
McConnell 
were 
radical outliers in our First Amendment tradition and our 
campaign ﬁnance jurisprudence. Each of these claims is 
wrong. 
The So-Called “Ban” 
Pervading the Court’s analysis is the ominous image of a 
“categorical ba[n]” on corporate speech. 
Ante, 
at 361. In­
deed, the majority invokes the specter of a “ban” on nearly 
every page of its opinion. 
Ante, 
at 319, 321, 324, 327, 328, 
329, 330, 333, 337, 339, 340, 343, 344, 345, 346, 347, 349, 351, 
354, 355, 358, 360, 361, 362, 364, 369. This characterization 
is highly misleading, and needs to be corrected. 
In fact it already has been. Our cases have repeatedly 
pointed out that, “[c]ontrary to the [majority’s] critical as­
sumptions,” the statutes upheld in 
Austin 
and 
McConnell 
do 
“not impose an 
absolute 
ban on all forms of corporate politi­
cal spending.” 
Austin, 
494 U. S., at 660; see also 
McCon­
nell, 
540 U. S., at 203–204; 
Beaumont, 
539 U. S., at 162–163. 
For starters, both statutes provide exemptions for PACs, 
separate segregated funds established by a corporation 
for political purposes. See 2 U. S. C. § 441b(b)(2)(C); Mich. 
Comp. Laws Ann. § 169.255 (West 2005). “The ability to 
form and administer separate segregated funds,” we ob­
served in 
McConnell, 
“has provided corporations and unions 
with a constitutionally sufﬁcient opportunity to engage in 
express advocacy. That has been this Court’s unanimous 
view.” 540 U. S., at 203. 
Under BCRA, any corporation’s “stockholders and their 
families and its executive or administrative personnel and 
their families” can pool their resources to ﬁnance electioneer­
ing communications. 2 U. S. C. § 441b(b)(4)(A)(i). A sig­
niﬁcant and growing number of corporations avail them­
selves of this option;

corporate and union PACs raised nearly a b
illion dol
lars.
30 
Administering a PAC entails some administrative burden, 
but so does complying with the disclaimer, disclosure, and 
reporting requirements that the Court today upholds, see 
ante, 
at 366–367, and no one has suggested that the burden 
is severe for a sophisticated for-proﬁt corporation. To the 
extent the majority is worried about this issue, it is impor­
tant to keep in mind that we have no record to show how 
substantial the burden really is, just the majority’s own un­
supported factﬁnding, see 
ante, 
at 337–339. Like all other 
natural persons, every shareholder of every corporation 
remains entirely free under 
Austin 
and 
McConnell 
to do 
however much electioneering she pleases outside of the cor­
porate form. The owners of a “mom & pop” store can sim­
ply place ads in their own names, rather than the store’s. 
If ideologically aligned individuals wish to make unlimited 
expenditures through the corporate form, they may ut
ilize 
an 
MCFL 
organization that has policies in place to avoid 
becoming a conduit for business or union interests. See 
MCFL, 
479 U. S., at 263–264. 
The laws upheld in 
Austin 
and 
McConnell 
leave open 
many additional avenues for corporations’ political speech. 
Consider the statutory provision we are ostensibly evaluat­
ing in this case, BCRA § 203. It has no application to genu­
ine issue advertising—a category of corporate speech Con­
gress found to be far more substantial than election-related 
advertising, see 
McConnell, 
540 U. S., at 207—or to Internet, 
30 
See Supp. Brief for Appellee 16 (citing FEC statistics placing this 
ﬁgure at $840 million). The majority ﬁnds the PAC option inadequate in 
part because “[a] PAC is a separate association from the corporation.” 
Ante, 
at 337. The formal “separateness” of PACs from their host corpora-
tions—which administer and control the PACs but which cannot funnel 
general treasury funds into them or force members to support them—is, 
of course, the whole point of the PAC mechanism.

sums on political communications with their executives and 
shareholders, § 441b(b)(2)(A); 11 CFR § 114.3(a)(1), to fund 
additional PAC activity through trade associations, 2 U. S. C. 
§ 441b(b)(4)(D), to distribute voting guides and voting rec­

Roaming far aﬁeld from the case at hand, the majority worries that 
the Government 
will use § 203 to ban 
books, pamphlets, and blogs. 
Ante, 
at 333, 337, 349, 364. Yet by its plain terms, § 203 does not apply to 
printed material. See 2 U. S. C. § 434(f)(3)(A)(i); see also 11 CFR 
§ 100.29(c)(1) (“[E]lectioneering communication does not include communi­
cations appearing in print media”). And in light of the ordinary under­
standing of the terms “broadcast, cable, [and] satellite,” 2 U. S. C. 
§ 434(f)(3)(A)(i), coupled with Congress’ clear aim of targeting “a virtual 
torrent of televised election-related ads,” 
McConnell, 
540 U. S., at 207, we 
highly doubt that § 203 could be interpreted to apply to a Web site or book 
that happens to be transmitted at some stage over airwaves or cable lines, 
or that the FEC would ever try to do so. See 11 CFR § 100.26 (exempting 
most Internet communications from regulation as advertising); § 100.155 
(exempting uncompensated Internet activity from regulation as an ex­
penditure); Supp. Brief for Center for Independent Media et al. as

media exemption to apply to a variety of non-traditional media”). If it 
should, the Government acknowledges “there would be quite [a] good as-
applied challenge.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 65 (Sept. 9, 2009).

As the Government points out, with a media corporation there is also 
a lesser risk that investors 
will not 
understand, learn about, or support

§ 114.4(c); § 114.2(f)(2), and to publicly endorse candidates 
through a press release and press conference, § 114.4(c)(6). 
At the time Citizens United brought this lawsuit, the only 
types of speech that could be regulated under § 203 were: 
(1) 
broadcast, cable, or satellite communications; 
33 
(2) capable 
of reaching at least 50,000 persons in the relevant elector­
ate; 
34 
(3) made within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a

35 
(4) by a labor union or a non-

nonmedia corporation; 
36 
(5) paid for with general

and (6) “susceptible of no reasonable in­

In many ways, then, § 203 functions as a source restriction 
or a time, place, and manner restriction. It applies in a 
viewpoint-neutral fashion to a narrow subset of advocacy 
messages about clearly identiﬁed candidates for federal of­
ﬁce, made during discrete time periods through discrete 
channels. In the case at hand, all Citizens United needed to 
do to broadcast 
Hillary 
right before the primary was to ab­
jure business contributions or use the funds in its PAC,

So let us be clear: Neither 
Austin 
nor 
McConnell 
held or 
implied that corporations may be silenced; the FEC is not a 
“censor”; and in the years since these cases were decided, 
corporations have continued to play a major role in the na­
tional dialogue. Laws such as § 203 target a class of commu­
nications that is especially likely to corrupt the political proc­
ess, that is at least one degree removed from the views of 
individual citizens, and that may not even reﬂect the views 
of those who pay for it. Such laws burden political speech, 
and that is always a serious matter, demanding careful scru­
tiny. But the majority’s incessant talk of a “ban” aims at 
a straw man. 
Identity-Based Distinctions

The case on which it relies for this proposition is 
First Nat. 
Bank of Boston 
v. 
Bellotti, 
435 U. S. 765 (1978). As I shall 
explain, 
infra, 
at 442–446, the holding in that case was far 
narrower than the Court implies. Like its paeans to unfet­
tered discourse, the Court’s denunciation of identity-based 
distinctions may have rhetorical appeal but it obscures 
reality. 
“Our jurisprudence over the past 216 years has rejected 
an absolutist interpretation” of the First Amendment. 
WRTL, 
551 U. S., at 482 (opinion of 
Roberts,
 
C. J.). The 
First Amendment provides that “Congress shall make no law 
. . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.” Apart 
perhaps from measures designed to protect the press, that 
text might seem to permit no distinctions of any kind. Yet 
in a variety of contexts, we have held that speech can be 
regulated differentially on account of the speaker’s identity, 
when identity is understood in categorical or institutional 
terms. The Government routinely places special restric­
tions on the speech rights of students,
41 
prisoners,
42 
members 
of the Armed Forces,
43 
foreigners,
44 
and its own employees.

When such restrictions are justiﬁed by a legitimate govern­

The majority states that the cases just cited are “inapposite” because 
they “stand only for the proposition that there are certain governmental 
functions that cannot operate without some restrictions on particular 
kinds of speech.” 
Ante, 
at 341. The majority’s creative suggestion that 
these cases stand only for that one proposition is quite implausible. In 
any event, the proposition lies at the heart of this case, as Congress and 
half the state legislatures have concluded, over many decades, that their 
core functions of administering elections and passing legislation cannot 
operate effectively without some narrow restrictions on corporate elec­
tioneering paid for by general treasury funds. 
47 
Outside of the law, of course, it is a commonplace that the identity and 
incentives of the speaker might be relevant to an assessment of his speech. 
See Aristotle, Poetics § 11.2(vi), pp. 43–44 (M. Heath transl. 1996) (“In eval­
uating any utterance or action, one must take into account not just the 
moral qualities of what is actually done or said, but also the identity of 
the agent or speaker, the addressee, the occasion, the means, and the mo­
tive”). The insight that the identity of speakers is a proper subject of 
regulatory concern, it bears noting, motivates the disclaimer and disclo­
sure provisions that the Court today upholds.

The free speech guarantee thus does not render every 
other public interest an illegitimate basis for qualifying a 
speaker’s autonomy; society could scarcely function if it 
did. It is fair to say that our First Amendment doctrine 
has “frowned on” certain identity-based distinctions, 
Los

United Reporting Publishing Corp.,

larly those that may reﬂect invidious discrimination or pref­
erential treatment of a politically powerful group. But it 
is simply incorrect to suggest that we have prohibited all 
legislative distinctions based on identity or content. Not 
even close. 
The election context is distinctive in many ways, and the 
Court, of course, is right that the First Amendment closely 
guards political speech. But in this context, too, the author­
ity of legislatures to enact viewpoint-neutral regulations 
based on content and identity is well settled. We have, for 
example, allowed state-run broadcasters to exclude inde­
pendent candidates from televised debates.

them directly, we have never cast doubt on laws that place 
special restrictions on campaign spending by foreign nation­
als. See, 
e. g., 
2 U. S. C. § 441e(a)(1). And we have consist­
ently approved laws that bar Government employees, but 
not others, from contributing to or participating in political 
activities. See n. 45, 
supra. 
These statutes burden the po­
litical expression of one class of speakers, namely, civil serv­
ants. Yet we have sustained them on the basis of longstand­
ing practice and Congress’ reasoned judgment that certain 
regulations which leave “untouched full participation 
...i n 
political decisions at the ballot box,” 
Civil Service Comm’n 
v. 
Letter Carriers, 
413 U. S. 548, 556 (1973) (internal quota­
tion marks omitted), help ensure that public ofﬁcials are “suf­
ﬁciently free from improper inﬂuences,” 
id., 
at 564, and that 
“conﬁdence in the system of representative Government is 
not . . . eroded to a disastrous extent,” 
id., 
at 565. 
The same logic applies to this case with additional force 
because it is the identity of corporations, rather than individ­
uals, that the Legislature has taken into account. As we 
have unanimously observed, legislatures are entitled to de­
cide “that the special characteristics of the corporate struc­
ture require particularly careful regulation” in an electoral 
context. 
NRWC, 
459 U. S., at 209–210.
50 
Not only has the 
distinctive potential of corporations to corrupt the electoral 
process long been recognized, but within the area of cam­
paign ﬁnance, corporate spending is also “furthest from the 
core of political expression, since corporations’ First Amend­
ment speech and association interests are derived largely 
over time, 
id., 
at 223. “In short,” I concluded, “Tennessee ha[d] failed to 
point to any legitimate interest that would justify its selective regulation 
of campaign-related expression.” 
Id.,

plicable to the case before us.

They are likewise entitled to regulate media corporations differently

from those of their members and of the public in receiving 
information,” 
Beaumont, 
539 U. S., at 161, n. 8 (citation omit­
ted). Campaign ﬁnance distinctions based on corporate 
identity tend to be less worrisome, in other words, because 
the “speakers” are not natural persons, much less members 
of our political community, and the governmental interests 
are of the highest order. Furthermore, when corporations, 
as a class, are distinguished from noncorporations, as a class, 
there is a lesser risk that regulatory distinctions will reﬂect 
invidious discrimination or political favoritism. 
If taken seriously, our colleagues’ assumption that the 
identity of a speaker has 
no 
relevance to the Government’s 
ability to regulate political speech would lead to some re­
markable conclusions. Such an assumption would have ac­
corded the propaganda broadcasts to our troops by “Tokyo 
Rose” during World War II the same protection as speech 
by Allied commanders. More pertinently, it would appear 
to afford the same protection to multinational corporations 
controlled by foreigners as to individual Americans: To do 
otherwise, after all, could “ ‘enhance the relative voice’ ” of 
some (
i. e., 
humans) over others (
i. e., 
nonhumans).

identity is untenable when it acknowledges that Congress might be al­
lowed to take measures aimed at “preventing foreign individuals or associ­
ations from inﬂuencing our Nation’s political process.” 
Ante, 
at 362. 
Such measures have been a part of U. S. campaign ﬁnance law for many 
years. The notion that Congress might lack the authority to distinguish 
foreigners from citizens in the regulation of electioneering would certainly 
have surprised the Framers, whose “obsession with foreign inﬂuence de­
rived from a fear that foreign powers and individuals had no basic invest­
ment in the well-being of the country.” Teachout, The Anti-Corruption 
Principle, 94 Cornell L. Rev. 341, 393, n. 245 (2009) (hereinafter Teachout); 
see also U. S. Const., Art. I, § 9, cl. 8 (“[N]o Person holding any Ofﬁce of

problem that corporations are not permitted to vote, given 
that voting is, among other things, a form of speech.
52 
In short, the Court dramatically overstates its critique of 
identity-based distinctions, without ever explaining why 
corporate identity demands the same treatment as individ­
ual identity. Only the most wooden approach to the First 
Amendment could justify the unprecedented line it seeks to 
draw. 
Our First Amendment Tradition

Aus­

First Amendment tradition. 
Ante,

The Court has it exactly backwards. It is today’s holding 
that is the radical departure from what had been settled 
First Amendment law. To see why, it is useful to take a 
long view.

ante, 
at 319 (internal

functory attempt to ground its analysis in the principles or

as its legal loyalties necessarily exclude patriotism.” Teachout 393,

but then again neither is a campaign expenditure; both are nevertheless 
communicative acts aimed at inﬂuencing electoral outcomes. Cf. Strauss,

understandings of those who drafted and ratiﬁed the Amend­
ment. Perhaps this is because there is not a scintilla of evi­
dence to support the notion that anyone believed it would 
preclude regulatory distinctions based on the corporate 
form. To the extent that the Framers’ views are discernible 
and relevant to the disposition of this case, they would ap­
pear to cut strongly against the majority’s position. 
This is not only because the Framers and their contempo­
raries conceived of speech more narrowly than we now think 
of it, see Bork, Neutral Principles and Some First Amend­
ment Problems, 47 Ind. L. J. 1, 22 (1971), but also because 
they held very different views about the nature of the First 
Amendment right and the role of corporations in society. 
Those few corporations that existed at the founding were 
authorized by grant of a special legislative charter.
53 
Cor­
porate sponsors would petition the legislature, and the legis­
lature, if amenable, would issue a charter that speciﬁed the 
corporation’s powers and purposes and “authoritatively ﬁxed

issued charters during the colonial period, and only a few hundred during 
all of the 18th century. See E. Dodd, American Business Corporations

ﬁgures; whereas we say that “a few hundred” charters were issued to 
business corporations during the 18th century, he says that the number is

also raises the more serious point that it is improper to assess 
these ﬁgures by today’s standards,

stantiate his claim that “the corporation was a familiar ﬁgure in American 
economic life” by the century’s end, 
ibid. 
(internal quotation marks omit­

vant reference point is not 1800 but the date of the First Amendment’s 
ratiﬁcation, in 1791. And at that time, the number of business charters 
must have been signiﬁcantly smaller than 335, because the pace of charter­
ing only began to pick up steam in the last decade of the 18th century. 
More than half of the century’s total business charters were issued be­
tween 1796 and 1800. Friedman, History of American Law, at 189.

The Framers thus took it as a given that corporations 
could be comprehensively regulated in the service of the 
public welfare. Unlike our colleagues, they had little trou­
ble distinguishing corporations from human beings, and 
when they constitutionalized the right to free speech in the 
First Amendment, it was the free speech of individual 
Americans that they had in mind.
55 
While individuals might 
join together to exercise their speech rights, business corpo­
rations, at least, were plainly not seen as facilitating such 
associational or expressive ends. Even “the notion that 
business corporations could invoke the First Amendment 
would probably have been quite a novelty,” given that “at 
the time, the legitimacy of every corporate activity was 
thought to rest entirely in a concession of the sovereign.”

understood “the freedom of speech” to encompass corporate speech is, 
I believe, far heavier than the majority acknowledges.

guaranty—the individual”). In light of these background 
practices and understandings, it seems to me implausible 
that the Framers believed “the freedom of speech” would 
extend equally to all corporate speakers, much less that it 
would preclude legislatures from taking limited measures to 
guard against corporate capture of elections. 
The Court observes that the Framers drew on diverse in­
tellectual sources, communicated through newspapers, and 
aimed to provide greater freedom of speech than had existed 
in England.

the Framers were focused on prior restraints on publication

As a matter of original expectations, then, it seems absurd 
to think that the First Amendment prohibits legislatures 
from taking into account the corporate identity of a sponsor 
of electoral advocacy. As a matter of original meaning, it 
likewise seems baseless—unless one evaluates the First 
Amendment’s “principles,” 
ante, 
at 319, 363, or its “purpose,” 
ante, 
at 376 (opinion of 
Roberts,
 
C. J.), at such a high level 
of generality that the historical understandings of the 
Amendment cease to be a meaningful constraint on the judi­
cial task. This case sheds a revelatory light on the assump­
tion of some that an impartial judge’s application of an origi­
nalist methodology is likely to yield more determinate 
answers, or to play a more decisive role in the decisional 
process, than his or her views about sound policy. 
Justice
 
Scalia
 
criticizes the foregoing discussion for fail­
ing to adduce statements from the founding era showing that 
corporations were understood to be excluded from the First 
Amendment’s free speech guarantee. 
Ante, 
at 386, 393. Of 
course, 
Justice
 
Scalia
 
adduces no statements to suggest 
the contrary proposition, or even to suggest that the con­
trary proposition better reﬂects the kind of right that the 
drafters and ratiﬁers of the Free Speech Clause thought they 
were enshrining. Although 
Justice
 
Scalia
 
makes a per­
fectly sensible argument that an individual’s right to speak 
entails a right to speak with others for a common cause, 
cf. 
MCFL, 
479 U. S. 238, he does not explain why those two 
rights must be precisely identical, or why that principle ap­
plies to electioneering by corporations that serve no “com­
mon cause.” 
Ante, 
at 392. Nothing in his account dislodges 
my basic point that members of the founding generation held 
a cautious view of corporate power and a narrow view of 
corporate rights (not that they “despised” corporations, 
ante, 
at 386), and that they conceptualized speech in individualistic 
terms. If no prominent Framer bothered to articulate that 
corporate speech would have lesser status than individual 
speech, that may well be because the contrary proposition—

also emphasizes the unqualiﬁed nature of 
the First Amendment text.

57 
Like virtually all modern lawyers, 
Justice
 
Scalia
 
presum­
ably believes that the First Amendment restricts the Execu­
tive, even though its language refers to Congress alone. In 
any event, the text only leads us back to the questions who 
or what is guaranteed “the freedom of speech,” and, just as 
critically, what that freedom consists of and under what cir­
cumstances it may be limited. 
Justice
 
Scalia
 
appears to 
believe that because corporations are created and utilized by 
individuals, it follows (as night the day) that their election­
eering must be equally protected by the First Amendment 
56 
Postratiﬁcation practice bolsters the conclusion that the First Amend­
ment, “as originally understood,” 
ante, 
at 353, did not give corporations 
political speech rights on a par with the rights of individuals. Well into 
the modern era of general incorporation statutes, “[t]he common law was 
generally interpreted as prohibiting corporate political participation,” 
First Nat. Bank of Boston 
v. 
Bellotti, 
435 U. S. 765, 819 (1978) (White, 
J., dissenting), and this Court did not recognize 
any 
First Amendment 
protections for corporations until the middle part of the 20th century, see 
ante, 
at 342 (listing cases). 
57 
In fact, the Free Press Clause might be turned against 
Justice
 
Scalia,
 
for two reasons. First, we learn from it that the drafters of the 
First Amendment did draw distinctions—explicit distinctions—between 
types of “speakers,” or speech outlets or forms. Second, the Court’s 
strongest historical evidence all relates to the Framers’ views on the 
press, see 
ante, 
at 353–354; 
ante, 
at 388–390 (
Scalia,
 
J., concurring), yet 
while the Court tries to sweep this evidence into the Free Speech Clause, 
the Free Press Clause provides a more natural textual home. The text 
and history highlighted by our colleagues suggests why one type of corpo­
ration, those that are part of the press, might be able to claim special First 
Amendment status, and therefore why some kinds of “identity”-based dis­
tinctions might be permissible after all. Once one accepts that much, the 
intellectual ediﬁce of the majority opinion crumbles.

ante, 
at 391–392. That conclusion certainly does not follow as a 
logical matter, and 
Justice
 
Scalia
 
fails to explain why the 
original public meaning leads it to follow as a matter of 
interpretation. 
The truth is we cannot be certain how a law such as BCRA 
§ 203 meshes with the original meaning of the First Amend­
ment.
58 
I have given several reasons why I believe the Con­
stitution would have been understood then, and ought to be 
understood now, to permit reasonable restrictions on corpo­
rate electioneering, and I will give many more reasons in the 
pages to come. The Court enlists the Framers in its defense 
without seriously grappling with their understandings of 
corporations or the free speech right, or with the republican 
principles that underlay those understandings. 
In fairness, our campaign ﬁnance jurisprudence has never 
attended very closely to the views of the Framers, see 
Ran­

Sorrell, 
548 U. S. 230, 280 (2006) (

of today. We have long since held that corporations are cov­
ered by the First Amendment, and many legal scholars have 
long since rejected the concession theory of the corporation. 
But “historical context is usually relevant,” 
ibid. 
(internal 
quotation marks omitted), and in light of the Court’s effort 
to cast itself as guardian of ancient values, it pays to remem­
ber that nothing in our constitutional history dictates today’s

how extraordinarily dissonant the decision is.

tion. At the federal level, the express distinction between 
corporate and individual political spending on elections 
stretches back to 1907, when Congress passed the Tillman 
Act, ch. 420, 34 Stat. 864, banning all corporate contributions 
to candidates. The Senate Report on the legislation ob­
served that “[t]he evils of the use of [corporate] money in 
connection with political elections are so generally recog­
nized that the committee deems it unnecessary to make any 
argument in favor of the general purpose of this measure. 
It is in the interest of good government and calculated to 
promote purity in the selection of public ofﬁcials.” S. Rep. 
No. 3056, 59th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1906). President Roose­
velt, in his 1905 annual message to Congress, declared: 
“ ‘All contributions by corporations to any political com­
mittee or for any political purpose should be forbidden 
by law; directors should not be permitted to use stock­
holders’ money for such purposes; and, moreover, a pro­
hibition of this kind would be, as far as it went, an effec­

practices acts.’ ”

power corporations had come to wield in federal elections, 
with the accompanying threat of both actual corruption and 
a public perception of corruption; and second, a respect for 
the interest of shareholders and members in preventing the 
use of their money to support candidates they opposed. See

Over the years, the limitations on corporate political

political practices that threatened to displace the common­
weal. Justice Souter recently traced these developments at 
length.

special signiﬁcance for this case. In that Act passed more 
than 60 years ago, Congress extended the prohibition on cor­
porate support of candidates to cover not only direct contri­
butions, but independent expenditures as well. Labor Man­
agement Relations Act, 1947, § 304, 61 Stat. 159. The bar on 
contributions “was being so narrowly construed” that corpo­

by supporting candidates through other means.

Our colleagues emphasize that in two cases from the mid­

Ante, 
at 343–344. Two features of these cases are of

the motives of legislatures are never entirely clear or unitary. Yet the 
basic shape and trajectory of 20th-century campaign ﬁnance reform are 
clear, and one need not take a naive or triumphalist view of this history 
to ﬁnd it highly relevant. The Court’s skepticism does nothing to mitigate 
the absurdity of its claim that

does it alter the fact that ﬁve Justices today destroy a longstanding Ameri­

expressed support for the principle that corporate and union 
political speech ﬁnanced with PAC funds, collected voluntar­
ily from the organization’s stockholders or members, receives 
greater protection than speech ﬁnanced with general treas­
ury funds.
60 
This principle was carried forward when Congress enacted 
comprehensive campaign ﬁnance reform in the Federal Elec­
tion Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), 86 Stat. 3, which re­
tained the restriction on using general treasury funds for 
contributions and expenditures, 2 U. S. C. § 441b(a). FECA

stockholder or union member”); 
Automobile Workers,

335 U. S. 106, 123 (1948) (observing

bar). Both the 
Pipeﬁtters 
and the

wealth on federal elections,” understood as wealth drawn from a corporate 
or union general treasury without the stockholders’ or members’ “free and

would not have read the statutory 
provision in question, a successor to § 304 of the Taft-Hartley Act, to allow 
such robust use of corporate and union funds to ﬁnance otherwise prohib­
ited electioneering. “This opening of the door to extensive corporate and 
union inﬂuence on the elective and legislative processes,” Justice Powell 
wrote, “must be viewed with genuine concern. This seems to me to be a 
regressive step as contrasted with the numerous legislative and judicial

codiﬁed the option for corporations and unions to create 
PACs to ﬁnance contributions and expenditures forbidden to 
the corporation or union itself. § 441b(b). 
By the time Congress passed FECA in 1971, the bar on 
corporate contributions and expenditures had become such 
an accepted part of federal campaign ﬁnance regulation that 
when a large number of plaintiffs, including several nonproﬁt 
corporations, challenged virtually every aspect of FECA in 
Buckley, 
424 U. S. 1, no one even bothered to argue that 
the bar as such was unconstitutional. 
Buckley 
famously (or 
infamously) distinguished direct contributions from inde­
pendent expenditures, 
id., 
at 58–59, but its silence on cor­
porations only reinforced the understanding that corporate 
expenditures could be treated differently from individual 
expenditures. “Since our decision in 
Buckley, 
Congress’ 
power to prohibit corporations and unions from using funds 
in their treasuries to ﬁnance advertisements expressly advo­
cating the election or defeat of candidates in federal elections 
has been ﬁrmly embedded in our law.” 
McConnell, 
540 
U. 
S., at 203. 
Thus, it was unremarkable, in a 1982 case holding that 
Congress could bar nonproﬁt corporations from soliciting 
nonmembers for PAC funds, that then-Justice Rehnquist 
wrote for a unanimous Court that Congress’ “careful legisla­
tive adjustment of the federal electoral laws, in a cautious 
advance, step by step, to account for the particular legal and 
economic attributes of corporations . . . warrants consider­
able deference,” and “reﬂects a permissible assessment of 
the dangers posed by those entities to the electoral process.” 
NRWC, 
459 U. S., at 209 (internal quotation marks and cita­
tion omitted). “The governmental interest in preventing 
both actual corruption and the appearance of corruption of 
elected representatives has long been recognized,” the unan­
imous Court observed, “and there is no reason why it may 
not . . . be accomplished by treating . . . corporations . . . 
differently from individuals.”

The corporate/individual distinction was not questioned by 
the Court’s disposition, in 1986, of a challenge to the expendi­
ture restriction as applied to a distinctive type of nonproﬁt 
corporation. In 
MCFL, 
479 U. S. 238, we stated again “that 
‘the special characteristics of the corporate structure require 
particularly careful regulation,’ ” 
id., 
at 256 (quoting 
NRWC, 
459 U. S., at 209–210), and again we acknowledged that the 
Government has a legitimate interest in “regulat[ing] the 
substantial aggregations of wealth amassed by the special 
advantages which go with the corporate form,” 479 U. S., at 
257 (internal quotation marks omitted). Those aggregations 
can distort the “free trade in ideas” crucial to candidate elec­
tions, 
ibid. 
(internal quotation marks omitted), at the ex­
pense of members or shareholders who may disagree with 
the object of the expenditures, 
id., 
at 260. What the Court 
held by a 5-to-4 vote was that a limited class of corporations 
must be allowed to use their general treasury funds for inde­
pendent expenditures, because Congress’ interests in pro­
tecting shareholders and “restrict[ing] ‘the inﬂuence of polit­
ical war chests funneled through the corporate form,’ ” 
id., 
at 
257 (quoting 
FEC

National Conservative Political Action 
Comm.,

corporations that were structurally insulated from those 
concerns.

Speciﬁcally, these corporations had to meet three conditions. First, 
they had to be formed “for the express purpose of promoting political 
ideas,” so that their resources reﬂected political support rather than com­
mercial success. 
MCFL, 
479 U. S., at 264. Next, they had to have no 
shareholders, so that “persons connected with the organization 
will 
have 
no economic disincentive for disassociating with it if they disagree with 
its political activity.” 
Ibid. 
Finally, they could not be “established by a 
business corporation or a labor union,” nor “accept contributions from such 
entities,” lest they “serv[e] as conduits for the type of direct spending that 
creates a threat to the political marketplace.”

far. 
They would have recognized congressional authority to 
bar general treasury electioneering expenditures even by 
this class of nonproﬁts; they acknowledged that “the threat 
from corporate political activity will vary depending on the 
particular characteristics of a given corporation,” but be­
lieved these “distinctions among corporations” were “distinc­
tions in degree,” not “in kind,” and thus “more properly 
drawn by the Legislature than by the Judiciary.” 479 U. S., 
at 268 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.) (internal quotation marks 
omitted). Not a single Justice suggested that regulation of 
corporate political speech could be no more stringent than of 
speech by an individual. 
Four years later, in 
Austin, 
494 U. S. 652, we considered 
whether corporations fa
lling 
outside the 
MCFL 
exception 
could be barred from using general treasury funds to make 
independent expenditures in support of, or in opposition to, 
candidates. We held they could be. Once again recognizing 
the importance of “the integrity of the marketplace of politi­
cal ideas” in candidate elections, 
MCFL, 
479 U. S., at 257, we 
noted that corporations have “special advantages—such as 
limited liability, perpetual life, and favorable treatment of 
the accumulation and distribution of assets,” 494 U. S., at 
658–659—that allow them to spend prodigious general treas­
ury sums on campaign messages that have “little or no corre­
lation” with the beliefs held by actual persons, 
id., 
at 660. 
In light of the corrupting effects such spending might have 
on the political process, 
ibid., 
we permitted the State of 
Michigan to limit corporate expenditures on candidate elec­
tions to corporations’ PACs, which rely on voluntary contri­
butions and thus “reﬂect actual public support for the politi­
cal ideas espoused by corporations,” 
ibid. 
Notwithstanding 
our colleagues’ insinuations that 
Austin 
deprived the public 
of general “ideas,” “facts,” and “ ‘knowledge,’ ” 
ante, 
at 354, 
355, the decision addressed only candidate-focused expendi­
tures and gave the State no license to regulate corporate 
spending on other matters.

In the 20 years since

Congress crafted § 203 in response to a problem 
created by 
Buckley. 
The 
Buckley 
Court had construed 
FECA’s deﬁnition of prohibited “expenditures” narrowly to 
avoid any problems of constitutional vagueness, holding it 
applicable only to “communications that expressly advocate 
the election or defeat of a clearly identiﬁed candidate,” 424 
U. 
S., at 80, 
i. e., 
statements containing so-called “magic 
words” like “ ‘vote for,’ ‘elect,’ ‘support,’ ‘cast your ballot for,’ 
‘Smith for Congress,’ ‘vote against,’ ‘defeat,’ [or] ‘reject,’ ” 
id., 
at 43–44, and n. 52. After 
Buckley, 
corporations and 
unions ﬁgured out how to circumvent the limits on express 
advocacy by using sham “issue ads” that “eschewed the use 
of magic words” but nonetheless “advocate[d] the election or

Id., 
at 127. Congress passed § 203 to address this cir­
cumvention, prohibiting corporations and unions from using 
general treasury funds for electioneering communications 
that “refe[r] to a clearly identiﬁed candidate,” whether or not 
those communications use the magic words. 2 U. S. C. 
§ 434(f)(3)(A)(i)(I). 
When we asked in 
McConnell 
“whether a compe

“easily answered”: “We have repeatedly sustained legislation 
aimed at ‘the corrosive and distorting effects of immense ag­
gregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of 
the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to 
the public’s support for the corporation’s political ideas.’ ” 
540 U. S., at 205 (quoting 
Austin, 
494 U. S., at 660). These 
precedents “represent respect for the legislative judgment 
that the special characteristics of the corporate structure re­
quire particularly careful regulation.” 540 U. S., at 205 (in­

3. 
Buckley and Bellotti 
Against this extensive background of congressional reg­
ulation of corporate campaign spending, and our repeated 
afﬁrmation of this regulation as constitutionally sound, the 
majority dismisses 
Austin 
as “a signiﬁcant departure from 
ancient First Amendment principles,” 
ante, 
at 319 (internal 
quotation marks omitted). How does the majority attempt 
to justify this claim? Selected passages from two cases, 
Buckley, 
424 U. S. 1, and 
Bellotti, 
435 U. S. 765, do all of the 
work. In the Court’s view, 
Buckley 
and 
Bellotti 
decisively 
rejected the possibility of distinguishing corporations from 
natural persons in the 1970’s; it just so happens that in every 
single case in which the Court has reviewed campaign ﬁ­
nance legislation in the decades since, the majority failed to 
grasp this truth. The Federal Congress and dozens of state 
legislatures, we now know, have been similarly deluded. 
The majority emphasizes 
Buckley
’s statement that “ ‘[t]he 
concept that government may restrict the speech of some 
elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice 
of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment.’ ” 
Ante, 
at 349–350 (quoting 424 U. S., at 48–49); 
ante, 
at 379 
(opinion of 
Roberts,
 
C. J.). But this elegant phrase cannot 
bear the weight that our colleagues have placed on it. For 
one thing, the Constitution does, in fact, permit numerous 
“restrictions on the speech of some in order to prevent a few 
from drowning out the many”: for example, restrictions on 
ballot access and on legislators’ ﬂoor time. 
Nixon

Buckley 
Court 
used this line in evaluating “the ancillary governmental in­
terest in equalizing the relative ability of individuals and 
groups to inﬂuence the outcome of elections.” 424 U. S., 
at 48. It is not apparent why this is relevant to the case 

442 CITIZENS UNITED 
v. 
FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N 
Opinion of 
Stevens,
 
J .
 
before us. The majority suggests that 
Austin 
rests on the 
foreign concept of speech equalization, 
ante, 
at 350; 
ante, 
at 
379–381 (opinion of 
Roberts,
 
C. J.), but we made it clear in 
Austin 
(as in several cases before and since) that a restric­
tion on the way corporations spend their money is no mere 
exercise in disfavoring the voice of some elements of our so­
ciety in preference to others. Indeed, we 
expressly 
ruled 
that the compe
lling i
nterest supporting Michigan’s statute 
was not one of “ ‘equaliz[ing] the relative inﬂuence of speak­
ers on elections,’ ” 
Austin, 
494 U. S., at 660 (quoting 
id., 
at 
705 (
Kennedy,
 
J., dissenting)), but rather the need to confront 
the distinctive corrupting potential of corporate electoral 
advocacy ﬁnanced by general treasury dollars, 
id., 
at 659–660. 
For that matter, it should go without saying that when we 
made this statement in 
Buckley, 
we could not have been 
casting doubt on the restriction on corporate expenditures 
in candidate elections, which had not been challenged as “for­
eign to the First Amendment,” 
ante, 
at 350 (quoting 
Buckley, 
424 U. S., at 49), or for any other reason. 
Buckley
’s inde­
pendent expenditure analysis was focused on a very different 
statutory provision, 18 U. S. C. § 608(e)(1) (1970 ed., Supp. V). 
It is implausible to think, as the majority suggests, 
ante, 
at 
346, that 
Buckley 
covertly invalidated FECA’s separate cor­
porate and union campaign expenditure restriction, § 610 
(now codiﬁed at 2 U. S. C. § 441b), even though that restric­
tion had been on the books for decades before 
Buckley 
and 
would remain on the books, undisturbed, for decades after. 
The case on which the majority places even greater weight 
than 
Buckley, 
however, is 
Bellotti, 
435 U. S. 765, claiming it 
“could not have been clearer” that 
Bellotti
’s holding forbade 
distinctions between corporate and individual expenditures 
like the one at issue here, 
ante, 
at 346. The Court’s reliance 
is odd. The only thing about 
Bellotti 
that could not be 
clearer is that it declined to adopt the majority’s position. 
Bellotti 
ruled, in an explicit limitation on the scope of its 
holding, that “our consideration of a corporation’s right to 

Cite as: 558 U. S. 310 (2010) 
443 
Opinion of 
Stevens,
 
J .
 
speak on issues of general public interest implies no compa­
rable right in the quite different context of participation in 
a political campaign for election to public ofﬁce.” 435 U. S., 
at 788, n. 26; see also 
id., 
at 787–788 (acknowledging that the 
interests in preserving public conﬁdence in Government and 
protecting dissenting shareholders may be “weighty . . . in 
the context of partisan candidate elections”). 
Bellotti, 
in 
other words, did not touch the question presented in 
Austin 
and 
McConnell, 
and the opinion squarely disavowed the 
proposition for which the majority cites it. 
The majority attempts to explain away the distinction 
Bel­
lotti 
drew—between general corporate speech and campaign 
speech intended to promote or prevent the election of speciﬁc 
candidates for ofﬁce—as inconsistent with the rest of the 
opinion and with 
Buckley. Ante, 
at 347, 357–360. Yet the 
basis for this distinction is perfectly coherent: The anticor­
ruption interests that animate regulations of corporate par­
ticipation in candidate elections, the “importance” of which 
“has never been doubted,” 435 U. S., at 788, n. 26, do not 
apply equally to regulations of corporate participation in ref­
erenda. A referendum cannot owe a political debt to a cor­
poration, seek to curry favor with a corporation, or fear the 
corporation’s retaliation. Cf. 
Austin, 
494 U. S., at 678 (
Ste­
vens,
 
J., concurring); 
Citizens Against Rent Control/Coali­
tion for Fair Housing 
v. 
Berkeley, 
454 U. S. 290, 299 (1981). 
The majority likewise overlooks the fact that, over the past 
30 years, our cases have repeatedly recognized the candi­
date/issue distinction. See, 
e. g., Austin, 
494 U. S., at 659; 
NCPAC, 
470 U. S., at 495–496; 
FCC 
v. 
League of Women Vot­
e r so fC a l . , 
468 U. S. 364, 371, n. 9 (1984); 
NRWC, 
459 U. S., 
at 210, n. 7. The Court’s critique of 
Bellotti
’s footnote 26 
puts it in the strange position of trying to elevate 
Bellotti 
to 
canonical status, while simultaneously disparaging a critical 
piece of its analysis as unsupported and irreconcilable with 
Buckley. Bellotti, 
apparently, is both the font of all wisdom 
and internally incoherent.

The 
Bellotti 
Court confronted a dramatically different fac­
tual situation from the one that confronts us in this case: a 
state statute that barred business corporations’ expenditures 
on some referenda but not others. Speciﬁcally, the statute 
barred a business corporation “from making contributions or 
expenditures ‘for the purpose of . . . inﬂuencing or affecting 
the vote on any question submitted to the voters, other than 
one materially affecting any of the property, business or 
assets of the corporation,’ ” 435 U. S., at 768 (quoting Mass. 
Gen. Laws Ann., ch. 55, § 8 (West Supp. 1977); alteration in 
original), and it went so far as to provide that referenda re­
lated to income taxation would not “ ‘be deemed materially 
to affect the property, business or assets of the corpora­
tion,’ ” 435 U. S., at 768. As might be guessed, the legisla­
ture had enacted this statute in order to limit corporate 
speech on a proposed state constitutional amendment to 
authorize a graduated income tax. The statute was a 
transparent attempt to prevent corporations from spending 
money to defeat this amendment, which was favored by a 
majority of legislators but had been repeatedly rejected by 
the voters. See 
id., 
at 769–770, and n. 3. We said that 
“where, as here, the legislature’s suppression of speech sug­
gests an attempt to give one side of a debatable public ques­
tion an advantage in expressing its views to the people, the 
First Amendment is plainly offended.” 
Id., 
at 785–786 (foot­
note omitted). 
Bellotti 
thus involved a 
viewpoint-discriminatory 
statute, 
created to effect a particular policy outcome. Even Justice 
Rehnquist, in dissent, had to acknowledge that “a very per­
suasive argument could be made that the [Massachusetts 
Legislature], desiring to impose a personal income tax but 
more than once defeated in that desire by the combination 
of the Commonwealth’s referendum provision and corporate 
expenditures in opposition to such a tax, simply decided to 
muzzle corporations on this sort of issue so that it could suc­
ceed in its desire.” 
Id., 
at 827, n. 6. To make matters

worse, the law at issue did not make any allowance for corpo­
rations to spend money through PACs. 
Id., 
at 768, n. 2 
(opinion of the Court). This really was a complete ban on a 
speciﬁc, preidentiﬁed subject. See 
MCFL, 
479 U. S., at 259, 
n. 
12 (stating that 2 U. S. C. § 441b’s expenditure restriction 
“is 
of course distinguishable 
from the complete foreclosure 
of any opportunity for political speech that we invalidated in 
the state referendum context i
n... 
Bellotti
” (emphasis 
added)). 
The majority grasps a quotational straw from 
Bellotti, 
that speech does not fall entirely outside the protection of 
the First Amendment merely because it comes from a corpo­
ration. 
Ante, 
at 346–347. Of course not, but no one sug­
gests the contrary, and neither 
Austin 
nor 
McConnell 
held 
otherwise. They held that even though the expenditures at 
issue were subject to First Amendment scrutiny, the restric­
tions on those expenditures were justiﬁed by a compe
lling 
state interest. See 
McConnell, 
540 U. S., at 205; 
Austin, 
494 
U. 
S., at 658, 660. We acknowledged in 
Bellotti 
that numer­
ous “interests of the highest importance” can justify cam­
paign ﬁnance regulation. 435 U. S., at 788–789. But we 
found no evidence that these interests were served by the 
Massachusetts law. 
Id., 
at 789. We left open the possibility 
that our decision might have been different if there had been 
“record or legislative ﬁndings that corporate advocacy 
threatened imminently to undermine democratic processes, 
thereby denigrating rather than serving First Amendment 
interests.” 
Ibid. 
Austin 
and 
McConnell, 
then, sit perfectly well with 
Bel­
lotti. 
Indeed, all six Members of the 
Austin 
majority had 
been on the Court at the time of 
Bellotti, 
and none so much 
as hinted in 
Austin 
that they saw any tension between the 
decisions. The difference between the cases is not that 
Aus­
tin 
and 
McConnell 
rejected First Amendment protection for 
corporations whereas 
Bellotti 
accepted it. The difference is 
that the statute at issue in 
Bellotti 
smacked of viewpoint 

446 CITIZENS UNITED 
v.

Opinion of 
Stevens,

discrimination, targeted one class of corporations, and pro­
vided no PAC option; and the State has a greater interest in 
regulating independent corporate expenditures on candidate 
elections than on referenda, because in a functioning democ­
racy the public must have faith that its representatives owe 
their positions to the people, not to the corporations with the 
deepest pockets. 
* * * 
In sum, over the course of the past century Congress has 
demonstrated a recurrent need to regulate corporate partici­
pation in candidate elections to “ ‘[p]reserv[e] the integrity 
of the electoral process, preven[t] corruption
,... 
sustai[n] 
the active, alert responsibility of the individual citizen,’ ” 
protect the expressive interests of shareholders, and “ ‘[p]re­
serv[e
]...t h ei
ndividual citizen’s conﬁdence in govern­
ment.’ ” 
McConnell, 
540 U. S., at 206–207, n. 88 (quoting 
Bellotti, 
435 U. S., at 788–789; ﬁrst alteration in original). 
These understandings provided the combined impetus be­
hind the Tillman Act in 1907, see 
Automobile Workers, 
352 
U. 
S., at 570–575, the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947, see 
WRTL, 
551 U. S., at 511 (Souter, J., dissenting), FECA in 1971, see 
NRWC, 
459 U. S., at 209–210, and BCRA in 2002, see 
McCon­
nell, 
540 U. S., at 126–132. Continuously for over 100 years, 
this line of “[c]ampaign ﬁnance reform has been a series of 
reactions to documented threats to electoral integrity obvi­
ous to any voter, posed by large sums of money from corpo­
rate or union treasuries.” 
WRTL, 
551 U. S., at 522 (Souter, 
J., dissenting). Time and again, we have recognized these 
realities in approving measures that Congress and the States 
have taken. None of the cases the majority cites is to the 
contrary. The only thing new about 
Austin 
was the dissent, 
with its stunning failure to appreciate the legitimacy of inter­
ests recognized in the name of democratic integrity since the 
days of the Progressives.

Having explained why this is not an appropriate case in 
which to revisit 
Austin 
and 
McConnell 
and why these deci­
sions sit perfectly well with “First Amendment principles,” 
ante, 
at 319, 363, I come at last to the interests that are at 
stake. The majority recognizes that 
Austin 
and 
McConnell 
may be defended on anticorruption, antidistortion, and 
shareholder protection rationales. 
Ante, 
at 348–362. It 
badly errs both in explaining the nature of these rationales, 
which overlap and complement each other, and in applying 
them to the case at hand. 
The Anticorruption Interest 
Undergirding the majority’s approach to the merits is the 
claim that the only “sufﬁciently important governmental in­
terest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corrup­
tion” is one that is “limited to 
quid pro quo 
corruption.” 
Ante, 
at 359. This is the same “crabbed view of corruption” 
that was espoused by 
Justice
 
Kennedy
 
in 
McConnell 
and 
squarely rejected by the Court in that case. 540 U. S., at 
152. 
While it is true that we have not always spoken about 
corruption in a clear or consistent voice, the approach taken 
by the majority cannot be right, in my judgment. It disre­
gards our constitutional history and the fundamental de­
mands of a democratic society. 
On numerous occasions we have recognized Congress’ le­
gitimate interest in preventing the money that is spent on 
elections from exerting an “ ‘undue inﬂuence on an ofﬁce­
holder’s judgment’ ” and from creating “ ‘the appearance of 
such inﬂuence,’ ” beyond the sphere of 
quid pro quo 
relation­
ships. 
Id., 
at 150; see also, 
e. g., id.,

Corruption can take many forms. Bribery may be the 
paradigm case. But the difference between se
lling a 
vote 
and selling 
access is a matter of degree, not kind. And sell­

ing access is not qualitatively different from giving special 
preference to those who spent money on one’s behalf. Cor­
ruption operates along a spectrum, and the majority’s appar­
ent belief that 
quid pro quo 
arrangements can be neatly de­
marcated from other improper inﬂuences does not accord 
with the theory or reality of politics. It certainly does not 
accord with the record Congress developed in passing 
BCRA, a record that stands as a remarkable testament to 
the energy and ingenuity with which corporations, unions, 
lobbyists, and politicians may go about scratching each 
other’s backs—and which amply supported Congress’ deter­
mination to target a limited set of especially destructive 
practices. 
The District Court that adjudicated the initial challenge to 
BCRA pored over this record. In a careful analysis, Judge 
Kollar-Kotelly made numerous ﬁndings about the corrupting 
consequences of corporate and union independent expendi­
tures in the years preceding BCRA’s passage. See 
McCon­
nell, 
251 F. Supp. 2d, at 555–560, 622–625; see also 
id., 
at 
804–805, 813, n. 143 (Leon, J.) (indicating agreement). As 
summarized in her own words: 
“The factual ﬁndings of the Court illustrate that cor­
porations and labor unions routinely notify Members of 
Congress as soon as they air electioneering communica­
tions relevant to the Members’ elections. The record 
also indicates that Members express appreciation to or­
ganizations for the airing of these election-related ad­
vertisements. Indeed, Members of Congress are par­
ticularly grateful when negative issue advertisements 
are run by these organizations, leaving the candidates 
free to run positive advertisements and be seen as 
‘above the fray.’ Political consultants testify that cam­
paigns are quite aware of who is running advertisements 
on the candidate’s behalf, when they are being run, and 
where they are being run. Likewise, a prominent lob­

byist testiﬁes that these organizations use issue ad­
vocacy as a means to inﬂuence various Members of 
Congress. 
“The Findings also demonstrate that Members of Con­
gress seek to have corporations and unions run these 
advertisements on their behalf. The Findings show 
that Members suggest that corporations or individuals 
make donations to interest groups with the understand­
ing that the money contributed to these groups will 
assist the Member in a campaign. After the elec­
tion, these organizations often seek credit for their 
support
....F i n a l l y ,a 
large majority of Americans (80%) 
are of the view that corporations and other organiza­
tions that engage in electioneering communications, 
which beneﬁt speciﬁc elected ofﬁcials, receive special 
consideration from those ofﬁcials when matters arise 
that affect these corporations and organizations.” 
Id., 
at 623–624 (citations and footnote omitted). 
Many of the relationships of dependency found by Judge 
Kollar-Kotelly seemed to have a 
quid pro quo 
basis, but 
other arrangements were more subtle. Her analysis shows 
the great difﬁculty in delimiting the precise scope of the 
quid 
pro quo 
category, as well as the adverse consequences that 
all 
such arrangements may have. There are threats of cor­
ruption that are far more destructive to a democratic society 
than the odd bribe. Yet the majority’s understanding of cor­
ruption would leave lawmakers impotent to address all but 
the most discrete abuses. 
Our “undue inﬂuence” cases have allowed the American 
people to cast a wider net through legislative experiments 
designed to ensure, to some minimal extent, “that ofﬁce­
holders will decide issue
s...o nt h e m e r i t so rt h e 
desires of 
their constituencies,” and not “according to the wishes of 
those who have made large ﬁnancial contributions”—or ex­
penditures—“valued by the ofﬁceholder.”

When private interests are seen to exert 
outsized control over ofﬁceholders solely on account of the 
money spent on (or withheld from) their campaigns, the re­
sult can depart so thoroughly “from what is pure or correct”

amounts to a “subversion

to represent its constituents [but also] the conﬁdence of its

the wishes of large contributors”). Though discrete in scope, these exper­
iments must impose some meaningful limits if they are to have a chance 
at functioning effectively and preserving the public’s trust. “Even if it

And unlike straight cash-for-votes transactions, such corruption is neither 
easily detected nor practical to criminalize.” 
McConnell,

There should be nothing controversial about the proposition that the 
inﬂuence being targeted is “undue.” In a democracy, ofﬁceholders should 
not make public decisions with the aim of placating a ﬁnancial benefactor, 
except to the extent that the benefactor is seen as representative of a 
larger constituency or its arguments are seen as especially persuasive.

Unlike the majority’s myopic focus on 
quid pro quo 
scenar­
ios and the free-ﬂoating “First Amendment principles” on 
which it rests so much weight, 
ante, 
at 319, 363, this broader 
understanding of corruption has deep roots in the Nation’s 
history. “During debates on the earliest [campaign ﬁnance] 
reform acts, the terms ‘corruption’ and ‘undue inﬂuence’ 
were used nearly interchangeably.” Pasquale, Reclaiming 
Egalitarianism in the Political Theory of Campaign Finance 
Reform, 2008 U. Ill. L. Rev. 599, 601. Long before 
Buckley, 
we appreciated that “[t]o say that Congress is without power 
to pass appropriate legislation to safeguard . . . an election 
from the improper use of money to inﬂuence the result is to 
deny to the nation in a vital particular the power of self 
protection.”

have been appalled by the evidence of corruption that Con­
gress unearthed in developing BCRA and that the Court 
today discounts to irrelevance. It is fair to say that “[t]he 
Framers were obsessed with corruption,” Teachout 348, 
which they understood to encompass the dependency of pub­
lic ofﬁceholders on private interests, see 
id., 
at 373–374; see 
also 
Randall, 
548 U. S., at 280 (
Stevens,
 
J., dissenting). 
They discussed corruption “more often in the Constitutional 
Convention than factions, violence, or instability.” Teachout 
352. 
When they brought our constitutional order into being, 
the Framers had their minds trained on a threat to republi­
can self-government that this Court has lost sight of. 
Quid Pro Quo Corruption 
There is no need to take my side in the debate over the 
scope of the anticorruption interest to see that the Court’s 
merits holding is wrong. Even under the majority’s 
“crabbed view of corruption,” 
McConnell, 
540 U. S., at 152, 
the Government should not lose this case. 
“The importance of the governmental interest in prevent­
ing [corruption through the creation of political debts] has 
never been doubted.” 
Bellotti, 
435 U. S., at 788, n. 26. 
Even in the cases that have construed the anticorruption in­
terest most narrowly, we have never suggested that such 
quid pro quo 
debts must take the form of outright vote buy­
ing or bribes, which have long been distinct crimes. Rather, 
they encompass the myriad ways in which outside parties 
may induce an ofﬁceholder to confer a legislative beneﬁt in 
direct response to, or anticipation of, some outlay of money 
the parties have made or will make on behalf of the ofﬁce­
holder. See 
McConnell, 
540 U. S., at 143 (“We have not lim­
ited [the anticorruption] interest to the elimination of cash­
for-votes exchanges. In 
Buckley, 
we expressly rejected the 
argument that antibribery laws provided a less restrictive 
alternative to FECA’s contribution limits, noting that such 
laws ‘deal[t] with only the most blatant and speciﬁc attempts

of those with money to inﬂuence governmental action’ ” 
(quoting 424 U. S., at 28; alteration in original)). It has like­
wise never been doubted that “[o]f almost equal concern as 
the danger of actual 
quid pro quo 
arrangements is the impact 
of the appearance of corruption.” 
Id., 
at 27. Congress may 
“legitimately conclude that the avoidance of the appearance 
of improper inﬂuence is also critical . . . if conﬁdence in the 
system of representative Government is not to be eroded to 
a disastrous extent.” 
Ibid. 
(internal quotation marks omit­
ted; alteration in original). A democracy cannot function ef­
fectively when its constituent members believe laws are 
being bought and sold. 
In theory, our colleagues accept this much. As applied to 
BCRA § 203, however, they conclude “[t]he anticorrup­
tion interest is not sufﬁcient to displace the speech here in 
question.” 
Ante, 
at 357. 
Although the Court suggests that 
Buckley 
compels its con­
clusion, 
ante, 
at 356–360, 
Buckley 
cannot sustain this read­
ing. It is true that, in evaluating FECA’s ce
iling on i
nde­
pendent expenditures by all persons, the 
Buckley 
Court 
found the governmental interest in preventing corruption 
“inadequate.” 424 U. S., at 45. But 
Buckley 
did not evalu­
ate corporate expenditures speciﬁcally, nor did it rule out the 
possibility that a future Court might ﬁnd otherwise. The 
opinion reasoned that an expenditure limitation covering 
only express advocacy (
i. e., 
magic words) would likely be 
ineffectual, 
ibid., 
a problem that Congress tackled in BCRA, 
and it concluded that “the independent advocacy restricted 
by [FECA § 608(e)(1)] 
does not presently appear 
to pose 
dangers of real or apparent corruption comparable to those 
identiﬁed with large campaign contributions,” 
id., 
at 46 
(emphasis added). 
Buckley 
expressly contemplated that an 
anticorruption rationale might justify restrictions on inde­
pendent expenditures at a later date, “because it may be 
that, in some circumstances, ‘large independent expenditures 
pose the same dangers of actual or apparent 
quid pro quo

arrangements as do large contributions.’ ” 
WRTL, 
551 U. S., 
at 478 (opinion of 
Roberts,
 
C. J.) (quoting 
Buckley, 
424 U. S., 
at 45). Certainly 
Buckley 
did not foreclose this possibility 
with respect to electioneering communications made with 
corporate general treasury funds, an issue the Court had no 
occasion to consider. 
The 
Austin 
Court did not rest its holding on 
quid pro quo 
corruption, as it found the broader corruption implicated by 
the antidistortion and shareholder protection rationales a 
sufﬁcient basis for Michigan’s restriction on corporate elec­
tioneering. 494 U. S., at 658–660. Concurring in that opin­
ion, I took the position that “the danger of either the fact, 
or the appearance, of 
quid pro quo 
relationships [also] pro­
vides an adequate justiﬁcation for state regulation” of these 
independent expenditures. 
Id., 
at 678. I did not see this 
position as inconsistent with 
Buckley
’s analysis of individual 
expenditures. Corporations, as a class, tend to be more at­
tuned to the complexities of the legislative process and more 
directly affected by tax and appropriations measures that 
receive little public scrutiny; they also have vastly more 
money with which to try to buy access and votes. See Supp. 
Brief for Appellee 17 (stating that the Fortune 100 compa­
nies earned revenues of $13.1 tr
illion during the 
last elec­
tion cycle). Business corporations must engage the political 
process in instrumental terms if they are to maximize share­
holder value. The unparalleled resources, professional lob­
byists, and single-minded focus they bring to this effort, 
I believed, make 
quid pro quo 
corruption and its appearance 
inherently more likely when they (or their conduits or trade 
groups) spend unrestricted sums on elections. 
It is with regret rather than satisfaction that I can now 
say that time has borne out my concerns. The legislative 
and judicial proceedings relating to BCRA generated a sub­
stantial body of evidence suggesting that, as corporations 
grew more and more adept at crafting “issue ads” to help

or harm a particular candidate, these nominally independent 
expenditures began to corrupt the political process in a very 
direct sense. The sponsors of these ads were routinely 
granted special access after the campaign was over; “candi­
dates and ofﬁcials knew who their friends were,” 
McConnell, 
540 U. S., at 129. Many corporate independent expendi­
tures, it seemed, had become essentially interchangeable 
with direct contributions in their capacity to generate 
quid 
pro quo 
arrangements. In an age in which money and tele­
vision ads are the coin of the campaign realm, it is hardly 
surprising that corporations deployed these ads to curry 
favor with, and to gain inﬂuence over, public ofﬁcials. 
The majority appears to think it decisive that the BCRA 
record does not contain “direct examples of votes being ex­
changed fo
r... 
expenditures.” 
Ante, 
at 360 (internal quota­
tion marks omitted). It would have been quite remarkable 
if Congress had created a record deta
iling 
such behavior by 
its own Members. Proving that a speciﬁc vote was ex­
changed for a speciﬁc expenditure has always been next to 
impossible: Elected ofﬁcials have diverse motivations, and no 
one will acknowledge that he sold a vote. Yet, even if “[i]n­
gratiation and access . . . are not corruption” themselves, 
ibid., 
they are necessary prerequisites to it; they can create 
both the opportunity for, and the appearance of, 
quid pro 
quo 
arrangements. The inﬂux of unlimited corporate money 
into the electoral realm also creates new opportunities for 
the mirror image of 
quid pro quo 
deals: threats, both explicit 
and implicit. Starting today, corporations with large war 
chests to deploy on electioneering may ﬁnd democratically 
elected bodies becoming much more attuned to their inter­
ests. The majority both misreads the facts and draws the 
wrong conclusions when it suggests that the BCRA record 
provides “only scant evidence that independent expenditures 
...i
ngratiate,” and that, “in any event,” none of it matters.

In her analysis of the record, Judge Kollar-Kotelly docu­
mented the pervasiveness of this ingratiation and explained 
its signiﬁcance under the majority’s own touchstone for de­
ﬁning the scope of the anticorruption rationale, 
Buckley. 
See 
McConnell, 
251 F. Supp. 2d, at 555–560, 622–625. Wit­
nesses explained how political parties and candidates used 
corporate independent expenditures to circumvent FECA’s 
“hard-money” limitations. See, 
e. g., id., 
at 478–479. One 
former Senator candidly admitted to the District Court that 
“ ‘[c]andidates whose campaigns beneﬁt from [phony “issue 
ads”] greatly appreciate the help of these groups. In fact, 
Members will also be favorably disposed to those who ﬁnance 
these groups when they later seek access to discuss pending 
legislation.’ ” 
Id., 
at 556 (quoting declaration of Sen. Dale 
Bumpers). One prominent lobbyist went so far as to state, 
in uncontroverted testimony, that “ ‘unregulated expendi­
tures—whether soft money donations to the parties or issue 
ad campaigns—can sometimes generate 
far more 
inﬂuence 
than direct campaign contributions.’ ” 
Ibid. 
(quoting decla­
ration of Wright Andrews; emphasis added). In sum, Judge 
Kollar-Kotelly found, “[t]he record powerfully demonstrates 
that electioneering communications paid for with the general 
treasury funds of labor unions and corporations endears 
those entities to elected ofﬁcials in a way that could be per­
ceived by the public as corrupting.” 
Id., 
at 622–623. She 
concluded that the Government’s interest in preventing the 
appearance of corruption, as that concept was deﬁned in 
Buckley, 
was itself sufﬁcient to uphold BCRA § 203. 251 
F. 
Supp. 2d, at 622–625. Judge Leon agreed. See 
id., 
at 
804–805 (dissenting only with respect to the Wellstone 
Amendment’s coverage of 
MCFL 
corporations). 
When the 
McConnell 
Court afﬁrmed the judgment of the 
District Court regarding § 203, we did not rest our holding 
on a narrow notion of 
quid pro quo 
corruption. Instead we 
relied on the governmental interest in combating the unique 
forms of corruption threatened by corporations, as recog­

nized in 
Austin
’s antidistortion and shareholder protection 
rationales, 540 U. S., at 205 (citing 
Austin, 
494 U. S., at 660), 
as well as the interest in preventing circumvention of contri­
bution limits, 540 U. S., at 128–129, 205, 206, n. 88. Had we 
felt constrained by the view of today’s Court that 
quid pro 
quo 
corruption and its appearance are the only interests that 
count in this ﬁeld, 
ante, 
at 348–362, we of course would have 
looked closely at that issue. And as the analysis by Judge 
Kollar-Kotelly reﬂects, it is a very real possibility that we 
would have found one or both of those interests satisﬁed and 
§ 203 appropriately tailored to them. 
The majority’s rejection of the 
Buckley 
anticorruption ra­
tionale on the ground that independent corporate expendi­
tures “do not give rise to 
[quid pro quo] 
corruption or the 
appearance of corruption,” 
ante, 
at 357, is thus unfair as well 
as unreasonable. Congress and outside experts have gener­
ated signiﬁcant evidence corroborating this rationale, and 
the only reason we do not have any of the relevant materials 
before us is that the Government had no reason to develop a 
record at trial for a facial challenge the plaintiff had aban­
doned. The Court cannot both

choose to reliti­
gate 
McConnell 
on appeal and then complain that the 
Government has failed to substantiate its case. If our 
colleagues were really serious about the interest in prevent­

quid pro quo 
corruption, they would remand to the 
District Court with instructions to commence evidentiary 
proceedings.

In fact, the notion that the “electioneering communications” covered 
by § 203 can breed 
quid pro quo 
corruption or the appearance of such 
corruption has only become more plausible since we decided 
McConnell. 
Recall that 
The

Justice
’s controlling opinion in 
WRTL 
subse­
quently limited BCRA’s deﬁnition of “electioneering communications” to 
those that are “susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as 
an appeal to vote for or against a speciﬁc candidate.” 551 U. S., at 470. 
The upshot was that after 
WRTL, 
a corporate or union expenditure could 
be regulated under § 203 only if everyone would understand it as an en­
dorsement of or attack on a particular candidate for ofﬁce. It does not

The insight that even technically independent expendi­
tures can be corrupting in much the same way as direct con­
tributions is bolstered by our decision last year in 
Caperton 
v. 
A. T. Massey Coal Co., 
556 U. S. 868 (2009). In that case, 
Don Blankenship, the chief executive ofﬁcer of a corporation 
with a lawsuit pending before the West Virginia high court, 
spent large sums on behalf of a particular candidate, Brent 
Benjamin, running for a seat on that court. “In addition 
to contributing the $1,000 statutory maximum to Benjamin’s 
campaign committee, Blankenship donated almost $2.5 mil­
lion to ‘And For The Sake Of The Kids,’ ” a § 527 corporation 
that ran ads targeting Benjamin’s opponent. 
Id., 
at 873. 
“This was not all. Blankenship spent, in addition, just over 
$500,000 on independent expenditures . . . ‘ “to support . . . 
Brent Benjamin.” ’ ” 
Ibid. 
(second alteration in original). 
Applying its common sense, this Court accepted petitioners’ 
argument that Blankenship’s “pivotal role in getting Justice 
Benjamin elected created a constitutionally intolerable prob­
ability of actual bias” when Benjamin later declined to recuse 
himself from the appeal by Blankenship’s corporation. 
Id., 
at 882. “Though n[o] 
...b r i b eo r c r i m i n a li
nﬂuence” was 
involved, we recognized that “Justice Benjamin would never­
theless feel a debt of gratitude to Blankenship for his ex­
traordinary efforts to get him elected.” 
Ibid. 
“The difﬁ­
culties of inquiring into actual bias,” we further noted, 
“simply underscore the need for objective rules,” 
id., 
at 
883—rules which will perforce turn on the appearance of 
bias rather than its actual existence. 
In 
Caperton, 
then, we accepted the premise that, at least 
in some circumstances, independent expenditures on candi­
date elections will raise an intolerable specter of 
quid pro 
quo 
corruption. Indeed, this premise struck the Court as 
so intuitive that it repeatedly referred to Blankenship’s 
spending on behalf of Benjamin—spending that consisted of 
take much imagination to perceive why this type of advocacy might be 
especially apt to look like or amount to a deal or a threat.

99.97% independent expenditures ($3 m
illion) and 
0.03% di­
rect contributions ($1,000)—as a “contribution.” See, 
e. g., 
id., 
at 872 (“The basis for the [recusal] motion was that the 
justice had received campaign contributions in an extraordi­
nary amount from” Blankenship); 
id., 
at 873 (referencing 
“Blankenship’s $3 m

contributions”); 
id., 
at 884 
(“Blankenship contributed some $3 m
illion to 
unseat the in­
cumbent and replace him with Benjamin”); 
id., 
at 885 (“Blan­
kenship’s campaign contributions . . . had a signiﬁcant and 
disproportionate inﬂuence on the electoral outcome”). The 
reason the Court so thoroughly conﬂated expenditures and 
contributions, one assumes, is that it realized that some ex­
penditures may be functionally equivalent to contributions 
in the way they inﬂuence the outcome of a race, the way they 
are interpreted by the candidates and the public, and the 
way they taint the decisions that the ofﬁceholder thereafter 
takes. 
Caperton 
is illuminating in several additional respects. It 
underscores the old insight that, on account of the extreme 
difﬁculty of proving corruption, “prophylactic measures, 
reaching some [campaign spending] not corrupt in purpose 
or effect, [may be] nonetheless required to guard against cor­
ruption.” 
Buckley, 
424 U. S., at 30; see also 
Shrink Mis­
souri, 
528 U. S., at 392, n. 5. It underscores that “certain 
restrictions on corporate electoral involvement” may like­
wise be needed to “hedge against circumvention of valid con­
tribution limits.”

quotation marks and brackets omitted); see also 
Colorado II, 
533 U. S., at 456 (“[A]ll Members of the Court agree that 
circumvention is a valid theory of corruption”). It under­
scores that for-proﬁt corporations associated with election­
eering communications will often prefer to use nonproﬁt con­
duits with “misleading names,” such as And For The Sake 
Of The Kids, “to conceal their identity” as the sponsor of 
those communications, thereby frustrating the utility of dis­

And it underscores that the consequences of today’s hold­
ing will not be limited to the legislative or executive context. 
The majority of the States select their judges through popu­
lar elections. At a time when concerns about the conduct of 
judicial elections have reached a fever pitch, see, 
e. g., 
O’Con­
nor, Justice for Sale, Wall St. Journal, Nov. 15, 2007, p. A25; 
Brief for Justice at Stake et al. as 
Amici Curiae 
2, the Court 
today unleashes the ﬂoodgates of corporate and union gen­
eral treasury spending in these races. Perhaps “
Caperton 
motions” will catch some of the worst abuses. This will be 
small comfort to those States that, after today, may no longer 
have the ability to place modest limits on corporate election­
eering even if they believe such limits to be critical to main­
taining the integrity of their judicial systems. 
Deference and Incumbent Self-Protection 
Rather than show any deference to a coordinate branch 
of Government, the majority thus rejects the anticorruption 
rationale without serious 
analysis.

Today’s opinion pro­
vides no clear rationale for being so dismissive of Congress,

America, incumbent legislators pass the laws that govern 
campaign ﬁnance, just like all other laws. To apply a level 
of scrutiny that effectively bars them from regulating 
electioneering whenever there is the faintest whiff of 
self-interest, is to deprive them of the ability to regulate 
electioneering. 
This is not to say that deference would be appropriate if

balance competing constitutional concerns, we have a vital 
role to play in ensuring that elections remain at least mini­
mally open, fair, and competitive. But it is the height of 
recklessness to dismiss Congress’ years of bipartisan deliber­
ation and its reasoned judgment on this basis, without ﬁrst 
conﬁrming that the statute in question was intended to be, 
or will function as, a restraint on electoral competition. 
“Absent record evidence of invidious discrimination against 
challengers as a class, a court should generally be hesitant to 
invalidate legislation which on its face imposes evenhanded 
restrictions.” 
Buckley, 
424 U. S., at 31. 
We have no record evidence from which to conclude that 
BCRA § 203, or any of the dozens of state laws that the Court 
today calls into question, reﬂects or fosters such invidious 
discrimination. Our colleagues have opined that “ ‘
any 
re­
striction upon a type of campaign speech that is equally 
available to challengers and incumbents tends to favor in­
cumbents.’ ” 
McConnell, 
540 U. S., at 249 (opinion of 
Scalia,
 
J.). This kind of airy speculation could easily be 
turned on its head. The electioneering prohibited by § 203 
might well tend to favor incumbents, because incumbents 
have pre-existing relationships with corporations and unions, 
and groups that wish to procure legislative beneﬁts may tend 
to support the candidate who, as a sitting ofﬁceholder, is al­
ready in a position to dispense beneﬁts and is statistically 
likely to retain ofﬁce. If a corporation’s goal is to induce 
ofﬁceholders to do its bidding, the corporation would do well 
to cultivate stable, long-term relationships of dependency. 
So we do not have a solid theoretical basis for condemning 
§ 203 as a front for incumbent self-protection, and it seems 
equally if not more plausible that restrictions on corporate 
electioneering will be self-denying. Nor do we have a good

empirical case for skepticism, as the Court’s failure to cite 
any empirical research attests. Nor does the legislative his­
tory give reason for concern. Congress devoted years of 
careful study to the issues underlying BCRA; “[f]ew legisla­
tive proposals in recent years have received as much sus­
tained public commentary or news coverage”; “[p]olitical sci­
entists and academic experts . . . with no self-interest in 
incumbent protectio[n] were central ﬁgures in pressing the 
case for BCRA”; and the legislation commanded bipartisan 
support from the outset. Pildes, The Supreme Court 2003 
Term Foreword: The Constitutionalization of Democratic 
Politics, 118 Harv. L. Rev. 28, 137 (2004). Finally, it is im­
portant to remember just how incumbent-friendly congres­
sional races were prior to BCRA’s passage. As the Solicitor 
General aptly remarked at the time, “the evidence supports 
overwhelmingly that incumbents were able to get re-elected 
under the old system just ﬁne.” Tr. of Oral Arg. in

In this case, then, “there is no convincing evidence that 
th[e] important interests favoring expenditure limits are

It is the denial of Congress’ authority to regulate corporate 
spending on elections. 
Austin and Corporate Expenditures 
Just as the majority gives short shrift to the general soci­
etal interests at stake in campaign ﬁnance regulation, it also 
overlooks the distinctive considerations raised by the regula­
tion of 
corporate 
expenditures. The majority fails to ap­
preciate that 
Austin
’s antidistortion rationale is itself an 
anticorruption rationale, see 494 U. S., at 660 (describing 
“a different type of corruption”), tied to the special concerns 
raised by corporations. Understood properly, “antidistor­
tion” is simply a variant on the classic governmental interest 
in protecting against improper inﬂuences on ofﬁceholders 
that debilitate the democratic process. It is manifestly not 
just an “ ‘equalizing’ ” ideal in disguise.

regulation, Garrett, New Voices in Politics: Justice Marshall’s Jurispru­
dence on Law and Politics, 52 How. L. J. 655, 667–668 (2009) (internal

Austin 
can bear an egali­
tarian reading, and I have no reason to doubt this characterization of Jus­
tice Marshall’s beliefs. But the fact that 
Austin 
can be read a certain way 
hardly proves 
The

it. Many of our precedents can bear multiple readings, and many of our 
doctrines have some “equalizing” implications but do not rest on an equal­
izing theory: for example, our takings jurisprudence and numerous rules 
of criminal procedure. More importantly, the 
Austin 
Court expressly de­
clined to rely on a speech-equalization rationale, see 494 U. S., at 660, and 
we have never understood 
Austin 
to stand for such a rationale. What­
ever his personal views, Justice Marshall simply did not write the opinion 
that 
The

suggests he did; indeed, he “would have viewed 
it as irresponsible to write an opinion that boldly staked out a rationale 
based on equality that no one other than perhaps Justice White would

Antidistortion 
The fact that corporations are different from human beings 
might seem to need no elaboration, except that the majority 
opinion almost completely elides it. 
Austin 
set forth some 
of the basic differences. Unlike natural persons, corpora­
tions have “limited liability” for their owners and managers, 
“perpetual life,” separation of ownership and control, “and 
favorable treatment of the accumulation and distribution of 
assets . . . that enhance their ability to attract capital and to 
deploy their resources in ways that maximize the return on 
their shareholders’ investments.” 494 U. S., at 658–659. 
Unlike voters in U. S. elections, corporations may be foreign 
controlled.
70 
Unlike other interest groups, business corpo­
rations have been “effectively delegated responsibility for 
ensuring society’s economic welfare”; 
71 
they inescapably 
structure the life of every citizen. “ ‘[T]he resources in the 
treasury of a business corporation,’ ” furthermore, “ ‘are not 
an indication of popular support for the corporation’s political 
ideas.’ ” 
Id.,

MCFL,

“ ‘They reﬂect instead the economically motivated decisions

It might also be added that corporations have no con­
sciences, no beliefs, no feelings, no thoughts, no desires. 
Corporations help structure and facilitate the activities of 
human beings, to be sure, and their “personhood” often 
serves as a useful legal ﬁction. But they are not themselves 
members of “We the People” by whom and for whom our 
Constitution was established. 
These basic points help explain why corporate electioneer­
ing is not only more likely to impair compe
lling 
governmen­
tal interests, but also why restrictions on that electioneering 
are less likely to encroach upon First Amendment freedoms. 
One fundamental concern of the First Amendment is to “pro­
tec[t] the individual’s interest in self-expression.”

Redish, The Value of Free Speech, 130 U. Pa. L. Rev. 
591, 594 (1982). Corporate speech, however, is derivative 
speech, speech by proxy. A regulation such as BCRA § 203 
may affect the way in which individuals disseminate certain 
messages through the corporate form, but it does not pre­
vent anyone from speaking in his or her own voice. “Within 
the realm of [campaign spending] generally,” corporate 
rate Law, 85 Va. L. Rev. 247 (1999) (hereinafter Blair & Stout), or any

Austin 
referred to the structure and the advan­

660, 665, 667, but its antidistortion argument relied only on the basic de­
scriptive features of corporations, as sketched above. It is not necessary 
to agree on a precise theory of the corporation to agree that corporations 
differ from natural persons in fundamental ways, and that a legislature 
might therefore need to regulate them differently if it is human welfare 
that is the object of its concern. Cf. Hansmann & Kraakman 441, n. 5.

spending is “furthest from the core of political expression.” 
Beaumont, 
539 U. S., at 161, n. 8. 
It is an interesting question “who” is even speaking when 
a business corporation places an advertisement that endorses 
or attacks a particular candidate. Presumably it is not the 
customers or employees, who typically have no say in such 
matters. It cannot realistically be said to be the sharehold­
ers, who tend to be far removed from the day-to-day deci­
sions of the ﬁrm and whose political preferences may be 
opaque to management. Perhaps the ofﬁcers or directors of 
the corporation have the best claim to be the ones speaking, 
except their ﬁduciary duties generally prohibit them from 
using corporate funds for personal ends. Some individuals 
associated with the corporation must make the decision to 
place the ad, but the idea that these individuals are thereby 
fostering their self-expression or cultivating their critical 
faculties is fanciful. It is entirely possible that the corpora­
tion’s electoral message will 
conﬂict 
with their personal con­
victions. Take away the ability to use general treasury 
funds for some of those ads, and no one’s autonomy, dignity, 
or political equality has been impinged upon in the least. 
Corporate expenditures are distinguishable from individ­
ual expenditures in this respect. I have taken the view that 
a legislature may place reasonable restrictions on individu­
als’ electioneering expenditures in the service of the govern­
mental interests explained above, and in recognition of the 
fact that such restrictions are not direct restraints on speech 
but rather on its ﬁnancing. See, 
e. g., Randall, 
548 U. S., at 
273 (dissenting opinion). But those restrictions concededly 
present a tougher case, because the primary conduct of ac­
tual, ﬂesh-and-blood persons is involved. Some of those in­
dividuals might feel that they need to spend large sums of 
money on behalf of a particular candidate to vindicate the 
intensity of their electoral preferences. This is obviously 
not the situation with business corporations, as their routine 
practice of giving “substantial sums to

“[C]orporate participation” in elections, any business 
executive will tell you, “is more transactional than ideologi­
cal.” Supp. Brief for Committee for Economic Development

Amicus Curiae 
10. 
In this transactional spirit, some corporations have af­
ﬁrmatively urged Congress to place limits on their election­
eering communications. These corporations fear that of­
ﬁceholders will shake them down for supportive ads, that 
they will have to spend increasing sums on elections in an 
ever-escalating arms race with their competitors, and that 
public trust in business will be eroded. See 
id., 
at 10–19. 
A system that effectively forces corporations to use their 
shareholders’ money both to maintain access to, and to avoid 
retribution from, elected ofﬁcials may ultimately prove more 
harmful than beneﬁcial to many corporations. It can impose 
a kind of implicit tax.
73 
In short, regulations such as § 203 and the statute upheld 
in 
Austin 
impose only a limited burden on First Amendment 
freedoms not only because they target a narrow subset of 
expenditures and leave untouched the broader “public dia­
logue,” 
ante, 
at 341, but also because they leave untouched 
73 
Not all corporations support BCRA § 203, of course, and not all corpo­
rations are large business entities or their tax-exempt adjuncts. Some 
nonproﬁt corporations are created for an ideological purpose. Some 
closely held corporations are strongly identiﬁed with a particular owner 
or founder. The fact that § 203, like the statute at issue in 
Austin, 
regu­
lates some of these corporations’ expenditures does not disturb the analy­
sis above. See 494 U. S., at 661–665. Small-business owners may speak 
in their own names, rather than the business’, if they wish to evade § 203 
altogether. Nonproﬁt corporations that want to make unrestricted elec­
tioneering expenditures may do so if they refuse donations from busi­
nesses and unions and permit members to disassociate without economic 
penalty. See 
MCFL, 
479 U. S. 238, 264 (1986). Making it plain that their 
decision is not motivated by a concern about BCRA’s coverage of non­
proﬁts that have ideological missions but lack

leagues refuse to apply the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment or the lower 
courts’

the speech of natural persons. Recognizing the weakness of 
a speaker-based critique of 
Austin, 
the Court places primary 
emphasis not on the corporation’s right to electioneer, but 
rather on the listener’s interest in hearing what every possi­
ble speaker may have to say. The Court’s central argument 
is that laws such as § 203 have “ ‘deprived [the electorate] of 
information, knowledge and opinion vital to its function,’ ” 
ante, 
at 354 (quoting 
CIO, 
335 U. S., at 144 (Rutledge, J., con­
curring in result)), and this, in turn, “interferes with the 
‘open marketplace’ of ideas protected by the First Amend­
ment,” 
ante, 
at 354 (quoting 
New York State Bd. of Elections 
v. 
Lopez Torres, 
552 U. S. 196, 208 (2008)). 
There are many ﬂaws in this argument. If the overriding 
concern depends on the interests of the audience, surely the 
public’s perception of the value of corporate speech should 
be given important weight. That perception today is the 
same as it was a century ago when Theodore Roosevelt deliv­
ered the speeches to Congress that, in time, led to the limited 
prohibition on corporate campaign expenditures that is over­
ruled today. See 
WRTL, 
551 U. S., at 509–510 (Souter, J., 
dissenting) (summarizing President Roosevelt’s remarks). 
The distinctive threat to democratic integrity posed by cor­

debate in ways that undermine rather than advance the in­
terests of listeners. The legal structure of corporations 
allows them to amass and deploy ﬁnancial resources on a 
scale few natural persons can match. The structure of a 
business corporation, furthermore, draws a line between the

corporation’s economic interests and the political preferences 
of the individuals associated with the corporation; the corpo­

(1992) (“[A] corporatio

should have as its objective the 
conduct of business activities with a view to enhancing cor­
porate proﬁt and shareholder gain”). In a state election 
such as the one at issue in 
Austin, 
the interests of nonresi­
dent corporations may be fundamentally adverse to the in­
terests of local voters. Consequently, when corporations 
grab up the prime broadcasting slots on the eve of an elec­
tion, they can ﬂood the market with advocacy that bears “lit­
tle or no correlation” to the ideas of natural persons or to 
any broader notion of the public good, 494 U. S., at 660. The 
opinions of real people may be marginalized. “The expendi­
ture restrictions of [2 U. S. C.] § 441b are thus meant to en­
sure that competition among actors in the political arena is 
truly competition among ideas.” 
MCFL,

In addition to this immediate drowning out of noncorpor­
ate voices, there may be deleterious effects that follow soon 
thereafter. Corporate “domination” of electioneering, 
Aus­
tin, 
494 U. S., at 659, can generate the impression that corpo­
rations dominate our democracy. When citizens turn on 
their televisions and radios before an election and hear only 
corporate electioneering, they may lose faith in their capac­
ity, as citizens, to inﬂuence public policy. A Government 
captured by corporate interests, they may come to believe, 
will be neither responsive to their needs nor w
illing to give 
their views a fair hearing. The predictable result is cyni­
cism and disenchantment: an increased perception that large 
spenders “ ‘call the tune’ ” and a reduced “ ‘w
illing
ness of vot­
ers to take part in democratic governance.’ ”

To the extent that corporations are allowed to exert undue 
inﬂuence in electoral races, the speech of the eventual win­
ners of those races may also be chilled. Politicians who fear 
that a certain corporation can make or break their reelection 
chances may be cowed into silence about that corporation. 
On a variety of levels, unregulated corporate electioneering 
might diminish the ability of citizens to “hold ofﬁcials ac­
countable to the people,” 
ante, 
at 339, and disserve the goal 
of a public debate that is “uninhibited, robust, and wide-
open,” 
New York Times Co. 
v. 
Sullivan, 
376 U. S. 254, 270 
(1964). At the least, I stress again, a legislature is entitled 
to credit these concerns and to take tailored measures in 
response. 
The majority’s unw
illing
ness to distinguish between cor­
porations and humans similarly blinds it to the possibility 
that corporations’ “war chests” and their special “advan­
tages” in the legal realm, 
Austin, 
494 U. S., at 659 (internal 
quotation marks omitted), may translate into special advan­
tages in the market for legislation. When large numbers of 
citizens have a common stake in a measure that is under 
consideration, it may be very difﬁcult for them to coordinate 
resources on behalf of their position. The corporate form, 
by contrast, “provides a simple way to channel rents to only 
those who have paid their dues, as it were. If you do not 
own stock, you do not beneﬁt from the larger dividends or 
appreciation in the stock price caused by the passage of 
private interest legislation.” Sitkoff, Corporate Political 
Speech, Political Extortion, and the Competition for Corpo­
rate Charters, 69 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1103, 1113 (2002). Corpo­
rations, that is, are uniquely equipped to seek laws that favor 
their owners, not simply because they have a lot of money 
but because of their legal and organizational structure. Re­
move all restrictions on their electioneering, and the door 
may be opened to a type of rent seeking that is “far more 
destructive” than what noncorporations are capable of.

The Court’s facile depiction of corporate electioneering as­

as if corporations were our society’s ablest debaters and 
viewpoint-neutral laws such as § 203 were created to sup­

yet another straw man, our colleagues simply ignore the fun­

Austin 
Court and the legislatures 
that have passed laws like § 203: to safeguard the integrity, 
competitiveness, and democratic responsiveness of the elec­

such thing as too much speech,” 
Austin,

If individuals in our society had 
inﬁnite free time to listen to and contemplate every last bit 
of speech uttered by anyone, anywhere; and if broadcast ad­
vertisements had no special ability to inﬂuence elections 
apart from the merits of their arguments (to the extent they 
make any); and if legislators always operated with noth­
ing less than perfect virtue; then I suppose the majority’s 
premise would be sound. In the real world, we have seen, 
corporate domination of the airwaves prior to an election 
may decrease the average listener’s exposure to relevant 
viewpoints, and it may diminish citizens’ w
illing

pacity to participate in the democratic process.

None of this is to suggest that corporations can or should 
be denied an opportunity to participate in election campaigns 
or in any other public forum (much less that a work of art 
such as 
Mr. Smith Goes to Washington

to deny that some corporate speech may contribute signiﬁ­
cantly to public debate. What it shows, however, is that 
Austin

process,” 
id.

governmental interests outside of the First Amendment. It 
also reﬂects a concern to 
facilitate 
First Amendment values 
by preserving some breathing room around the electoral 
“marketplace” of ideas, 
ante, 
at 335, 350, 354, 367, 369, the 
marketplace in which the actual people of this Nation deter­
mine how they will govern themselves. The majority seems 
oblivious to the simple truth that laws such as § 203 do not 
merely pit the anticorruption interest against the First 
Amendment, but also pit competing First Amendment val­
ues against each other. There are, to be sure, serious con­
cerns with any effort to balance the First Amendment rights 
of speakers against the First Amendment rights of listeners. 
But when the speakers in question are not real people and 
when the appeal to “First Amendment principles” depends 
almost entirely on the listeners’ perspective, 
ante, 
at 319, 
363, it becomes necessary to consider how listeners will actu­
ally be affected. 
In critiquing 
Austin
’s antidistortion rationale and cam­
paign ﬁnance regulation more generally, our colleagues place 
tremendous weight on the example of media corporations.

it is not at all clear that 
Austin 
would permit § 203 to be 
applied to them. The press plays a unique role not only in 
the text, history, and structure of the First Amendment but 
also in facilitating public discourse; as the 
Austin 
Court ex­
plained, “media corporations differ signiﬁcantly from other 
corporations in that their resources are devoted to the collec­

tion of information and its dissemination to the public,” 494 
U. 
S., at 667. Our colleagues have raised some interesting 
and difﬁcult questions about Congress’ authority to regulate 
electioneering by the press, and about how to deﬁne what 
constitutes the press. 
But that is not the case before us. 
Section 203 does not apply to media corporations, and even 
if it did, Citizens United is not a media corporation. There 
would be absolutely no reason to consider the issue of media 
corporations if the majority did not, ﬁrst, transform Citizens 
United’s as-applied challenge into a facial challenge and, sec­
ond, invent the theory that legislatures must eschew all 
“identity”-based distinctions and treat a local nonproﬁt news 
outlet exactly the same as General Motors.
75 
This calls to 
mind George Berkeley’s description of philosophers: “[W]e 
have ﬁrst raised a dust, and then complain we cannot see.” 
Principles of Human Knowledge/Three Dialogues 38, ¶ 3 (R. 
Woolhouse ed. 1988). 
It would be perfectly understandable if our colleagues 
feared that a campaign ﬁnance regulation such as § 203 may 
be counterproductive or self-interested, and therefore at­
tended carefully to the choices the Legislature has made. 
But the majority does not bother to consider such practical 
matters, or even to consult a record; it simply stipulates that 
“enlightened self-government” can arise only in the absence 
of regulation. 
Ante, 
at 339. In light of the distinctive fea­
tures of corporations identiﬁed in 
Austin, 
there is no valid 
basis for this assumption. The marketplace of ideas is not 
actually a place where items—or laws—are meant to be 
bought and sold, and when we move from the realm of eco­
75 
Under the majority’s view, the legislature is thus damned if it does 
and damned if it doesn’t. If the legislature gives media corporations an 
exemption from electioneering regulations that apply to other corpora­
tions, it violates the newly minted First Amendment rule against 
identity-based distinctions. If the legislature does not give media corpo­
rations an exemption, it violates the First Amendment rights of the press. 
The only way out of this invented bind: no regulations whatsoever.

nomics to the realm of corporate electioneering, there may 
be no “reason to think the market ordering is intrinsically 
good at all,” Strauss 1386. 
The Court’s blinkered and aphoristic approach to the First 
Amendment may well promote corporate power at the cost 
of the individual and collective self-expression the Amend­
ment was meant to serve. It will undoubtedly cripple the 
ability of ordinary citizens, Congress, and the States to adopt 
even limited measures to protect against corporate domina­
tion of the electoral process. Americans may be forgiven if 
they do not feel the Court has advanced the cause of self-
government today. 
2. 
Shareholder Protection 
There is yet another way in which laws such as § 203 can 
serve First Amendment values. Interwoven with 
Austin
’s 
concern to protect the integrity of the electoral process is a 
concern to protect the rights of shareholders from a kind 
of coerced speech: electioneering expenditures that do not 
“reﬂec[t] [their] support.” 494 U. S., at 660–661. When cor­
porations use general treasury funds to praise or attack a 
particular candidate for ofﬁce, it is the shareholders, as the 
residual claimants, who are effectively footing the bill. 
Those shareholders who disagree with the corporation’s elec­
toral message may ﬁnd their ﬁnancial investments being 
used to undermine their political convictions. 
The PAC mechanism, by contrast, helps ensure that those 
who pay for an electioneering communication actually sup­
port its content and that managers do not use general treas­
uries to advance personal agendas. 
Ibid. 
It “ ‘allows cor­
porate political participation without the temptation to use 
corporate funds for political inﬂuence, quite possibly at odds 
with the sentiments of some shareholders or members.’ ” 
McConnell, 
540 U. S., at 204 (quoting 
Beaumont, 
539 U. S.,

more than facilitate the political speech of like-minded share­

holders; it also curbs the rent seeking behavior of executives 
and respects the views of dissenters. 
Austin
’s acceptance 
of restrictions on general treasury spending “simply allows 
people who have invested in the business corporation for 
purely economic reasons”—the vast majority of investors, 
one assumes—“to avoid being taken advantage of, with­
out sacriﬁcing their economic objectives.” Winkler, Beyond 
Bellotti, 
32 Loyola (LA) L. Rev. 133, 201 (1998). 
The concern to protect dissenting shareholders and union 
members has a long history in campaign ﬁnance reform. It 
provided a central motivation for the Tillman Act in 1907 
and subsequent legislation, see 
Pipeﬁtters 
v. 
United States, 
407 U. S. 385, 414–415 (1972); Winkler, 92 Geo. L. J., at 887– 
900, and it has been endorsed in a long line of our cases, see,

Pipeﬁtters,

Indeed, we have unanimously recognized the gov­
ernmental interest in “protect[ing] the individuals who have 
paid money into a corporation or union for purposes other 
than the support of candidates from having that money used 
to support political candidates to whom they may be op­
posed.” 
NRWC, 
459 U. S., at 207–208. 
The Court dismisses this interest on the ground that 
abuses of shareholder money can be corrected “through the 
procedures of corporate democracy,”

at 362 (internal 
quotation marks omitted), and, it seems, through Internet-
based disclosures,

I fail to understand 
76 
I note that, among the many other regulatory possibilities it has left 
open, ranging from new versions of § 203 supported by additional evidence 
of 
quid pro quo 
corruption or its appearance to any number of tax incen­
tive or public ﬁnancing schemes, today’s decision does not require that a 
legislature rely solely on these mechanisms to protect shareholders. Leg­
islatures remain free in their incorporation and tax laws to condition the 
types of activity in which corporations may engage, including electioneer­
ing activity, on speciﬁc disclosure requirements or on prior express ap­
proval by shareholders or members.

how this addresses the concerns of dissenting union mem­
bers, who will also be affected by today’s ruling, and I fail to 
understand why the Court is so conﬁdent in these mecha­
nisms. By “corporate democracy,” presumably the Court 
means the rights of shareholders to vote and to bring deriva­
tive suits for breach of ﬁduciary duty. In practice, however, 
many corporate lawyers will tell you that “these rights are 
so limited as to be almost nonexistent,” given the internal 
authority wielded by boards and managers and the expansive 
protections afforded by the business judgment rule. Blair & 
Stout 320; see also 
id., 
at 298–315; Winkler, 32 Loyola (LA) 
L. 
Rev., at 165–166, 199–200. Modern technology may help 
make it easier to track corporate activity, including electoral 
advocacy, but it is utopian to believe that it solves the prob­
lem. Most American households that own stock do so 
through intermediaries such as mutual funds and pension 
plans, see Evans, A Requiem for the Retail Investor? 95 Va. 
L. 
Rev. 1105 (2009), which makes it more difﬁcult both to 
monitor and to alter particular holdings. Studies show that 
a majority of individual investors make no trades at all dur­
ing a given year. 
Id., 
at 1117. Moreover, if the corporation 
in question operates a PAC, an investor who sees the com­
pany’s ads may not know whether they are being funded 
through the PAC or through the general treasury. 
If and when shareholders learn that a corporation has been 
spending general treasury money on objectionable election­
eering, they can divest. Even assuming that they reliably 
learn as much, however, this solution is only partial. The 
injury to the shareholders’ expressive rights has already oc­
curred; they might have preferred to keep that corporation’s 
stock in their portfolio for any number of economic reasons; 
and they may incur a capital gains tax or other penalty from 
selling 
their shares, changing their pension plan, or the like. 
The shareholder protection rationale has been criticized as 
underinclusive, in that corporations also spend money on lob­
bying and charitable contributions in ways that any particu­

478 CITIZENS UNITED

lar shareholder might disapprove. But those expenditures 
do not implicate the selection of public ofﬁcials, an area in 
which “the interests of unw
illing . . . cor
porate shareholders 
[in not being] forced to subsidize that speech” “are at their 
zenith.” 
Austin, 
494 U. S., at 677 (Brennan, J., concurring). 
And in any event, the question is whether shareholder pro­
tection provides a basis for regulating expenditures in the 
weeks before an election, not whether additional types of 
corporate communications might similarly be conditioned 
on voluntariness. 
Recognizing the limits of the shareholder protection ra­
tionale, the 
Austin 
Court did not hold it out as an adequate 
and independent ground for sustaining the statute in ques­
tion. Rather, the Court applied it to reinforce the anti-
distortion rationale, in two main ways. First, the problem 
of dissenting shareholders shows that even if electioneer­
ing expenditures can advance the political views of some 
members of a corporation, they will often compromise the 
views of others. See, 
e. g., id., 
at 663 (discussing risk that 
corporation’s “members may b
e... 
reluctant to withdraw as 
members even if they disagree with [its] political expres­
sion”). Second, it provides an additional reason, beyond 
the distinctive legal attributes of the corporate form, for 
doubting that these “expenditures reﬂect actual public 
support for the political ideas espoused,” 
id., 
at 660. The 
shareholder protection rationale, in other words, bolsters the 
conclusion that restrictions on corporate electioneering can 
serve both speakers’ and listeners’ interests, as well as the 
anticorruption interest. And it supplies yet another reason 
why corporate expenditures merit less protection than indi­
vidual expenditures. 
V 
Today’s decision is backwards in many senses. It elevates 
the majority’s agenda over the litigants’ submissions, facial 
attacks over as-applied claims, broad constitutional theories

over narrow statutory grounds, individual dissenting opin­
ions over precedential holdings, assertion over tradition, 
absolutism over empiricism, rhetoric over reality. Our 
colleagues have arrived at the conclusion that 
Austin 
must 
be overruled and that § 203 is facially unconstitutional only 
after mischaracterizing both the reach and rationale of those 
authorities, and after bypassing or ignoring rules of judicial 
restraint used to cabin the Court’s lawmaking power. Their 
conclusion that the societal interest in avoiding corruption 
and the appearance of corruption does not provide an ade­
quate justiﬁcation for regulating corporate expenditures on 
candidate elections relies on an incorrect description of that 
interest, along with a failure to acknowledge the relevance 
of established facts and the considered judgments of state 
and federal legislatures over many decades. 
In a democratic society, the longstanding consensus on the 
need to limit corporate campaign spending should outweigh 
the wooden application of judge-made rules. The majority’s 
rejection of this principle “elevate[s] corporations to a level 
of deference which has not been seen at least since the days 
when substantive due process was regularly used to invali­
date regulatory legislation thought to unfairly impinge upon 
established economic interests.” 
Bellotti, 
435 U. S., at 817, 
n. 
13 (White, J., dissenting). At bottom, the Court’s opinion 
is thus a rejection of the common sense of the American peo­
ple, who have recognized a need to prevent corporations 
from undermining self-government since the founding, and 
who have fought against the distinctive corrupting potential 
of corporate electioneering since the days of Theodore Roo­
sevelt. It is a strange time to repudiate that common sense. 
While American democracy is imperfect, few outside the ma­
jority of this Court would have thought its ﬂaws included a 
dearth of corporate money in politics. 
I would afﬁrm the judgment of the District Court.

Political speech is entitled to robust protection under the 
First Amendment. Section 203 of the Bipartisan Campaign 
Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA) has never been reconcilable with 
that protection. By striking down § 203, the Court takes

California’s Constitution to provide that “[o]nly marriage be­
tween a man and a woman is valid or recognized in Califor­

than $100 to any committee supporting or opposing Proposi­
tion 8 was required to disclose his full name, street address, 
occupation, employer’s name (or business name, if self-
employed), and the total amount of his contributions.

See 
Cal. Govt. Code Ann. § 84211(f) (West 2005). The California 
Secretary of State was then required to post this informa­
tion on the Internet. See §§ 84600–84601; §§ 84602–84602.1

Some opponents of Proposition 8 compiled this information 
and created Web sites with maps showing the locations of 
homes or businesses of Proposition 8 supporters. Many sup­
porters (or their customers) suffered property damage, or 
threats of physical violence or death, as a result. They cited 
these incidents in a complaint they ﬁled after the 2008 elec­

Those accounts are consistent with media reports describ­
ing Proposition 8-related retaliation. The director of the 
nonproﬁt California Musical Theater gave $1,000 to support 
the initiative; he was forced to resign after artists com­
plained to his employer. Lott & Smith, Donor Disclosure 
Has Its Downsides, Wall Street Journal, Dec. 26, 2008, 
p. 
A13. The director of the Los Angeles Film Festival was 
forced to resign after giving $1,500 because opponents 
threatened to boycott and picket the next festival. 
Ibid. 
And a woman who had managed her popular, family-owned 
restaurant for 26 years was forced to resign after she gave 
$100, because “throngs of [angry] protesters” repeatedly 
arrived at the restaurant and “shout[ed] ‘shame on you’ at 
customers.” Lopez, Prop. 8 Stance Upends Her Life, 
Los Angeles Times, Dec. 14, 2008, p. B1. The police even 
had to “arriv[e] in riot gear one night to quell the angry mob” 
at the restaurant. 
Ibid. 
Some supporters of Proposition 8 
engaged in similar tactics; one real estate businessman in 
San Diego who had donated to a group opposing Proposition 
8 “received a letter from the Prop. 8 Executive Committee 
threatening to publish his company’s name if he didn’t also 
donate to the ‘Yes on 8’ campaign.” Donor Disclosure, 
supra, 
at A13. 
The success of such intimidation tactics has apparently 
spawned a cottage industry that uses forcibly disclosed donor 
information to 
pre-empt 
citizens’ exercise of their First 
Amendment rights. Before the 2008 Presidential election, a 
“newly formed nonproﬁt group . . . plann[ed] to confront do­
nors to conservative groups, hoping to create a ch
illing 
effect 
that will dry up contributions.” Luo, Group Plans Cam­

legal trouble, public exposure and watchdog groups digging 
through their lives.” 
Ibid. 
These instances of retaliation sufﬁciently demonstrate why 
this Court should invalidate mandatory disclosure and re­
porting requirements. But 
amici 
present evidence of yet 
another reason to do so—the threat of retaliation from 
elected ofﬁcials. 
As 
amici’
s submissions make clear, this 
threat extends far beyond a single ballot proposition in Cali­
fornia. For example, a candidate challenging an incumbent 
state attorney general reported that some members of the 
State’s business community feared donating to his campaign 
because they did not want to cross the incumbent; in his 
words, “ ‘I go to so many people and hear the same thing: 
“I sure hope you beat [the incumbent], but I can’t afford to 
have my name on your records. He might come after me 
next.” ’ ” Strassel, Challenging Spitzerism at the Polls, Wall 
Street Journal, Aug. 1, 2008, p. A11. The incumbent won 
reelection in 2008. 
My point is not to express any view on the merits of the 
political controversies I describe. Rather, it is to demon­
strate—using real-world, recent examples—the fallacy in the 
Court’s conclusion that “[d]isclaimer and disclosure require­
ment
s...i
mpose no ce
iling on 
campaign-related activities, 
and do not prevent anyone from speaking.” 
Ante,

(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Of course 
they do. Disclaimer and disclosure requirements enable pri­
vate citizens and elected ofﬁcials to implement political strat­
egies 
speciﬁcally calculated 
to curtail campaign-related 
activity and prevent the lawful, peaceful exercise of First 
Amendment rights. 
The Court nevertheless insists that as-applied challenges 
to disclosure requirements will sufﬁce to vindicate those 
speech rights, as long as potential plaintiffs can “show a rea­
sonable probability that disclosure . . . will subject them to 
threats, harassment, or reprisals from either Government of­

ﬁcials or private parties.” 
Ante, 
at 367 (internal quotation 
marks omitted). But the Court’s opinion itself proves the 
irony in this compromise. In correctly explaining why it 
must address the facial constitutionality of § 203, see 
ante, 
at 
322–336, the Court recognizes that “[t]he First Amendment 
does not permit laws that force speakers t
o... 
seek declara­
tory rulings before discussing the most salient political is­
sues of our day,” 
ante, 
at 324; that as-applied challenges to 
§ 203 “would require substantial litigation over an extended 
time” and result in an “interpretive process [that] itself 
would create an inevitable, pervasive, and serious risk of 
chilling 
protected speech pending the drawing of ﬁne distinc­
tions that, in the end, would themselves be questionable,” 
ante, 
at 326–327; that “a court would be remiss in performing 
its duties were it to accept an unsound principle merely to 
avoid the necessity of making a broader ruling,” 
ante, 
at 329; 
and that avoiding a facial challenge to § 203 “would prolong 
the substantial, nationwide ch
illing 
effect” that § 203 causes, 
ante, 
at 333. This logic, of course, applies equally to as-
applied challenges to §§ 201 and 311. 
Irony aside, the Court’s promise that as-applied challenges 
will adequately protect speech is a hollow assurance. Now 
more than ever, §§ 201 and 311 will chill protected speech 
because—as California voters can attest—“the advent of 
the Internet” enables “prompt disclosure of expenditures,” 
which “provide[s]” political opponents “with the information 
needed” to intimidate and retaliate against their foes. 
Ante, 
at 370. Thus, “disclosure permits citizen
s...t o 
react to the 
speech of [their political opponents] in a proper”—or undeni­
ably 
improper
—“way” long before a plaintiff could prevail 
on an as-applied challenge.
