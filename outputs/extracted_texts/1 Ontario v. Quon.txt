No. 08–1332. Argued April 19, 2010—Decided June 17, 2010 
Petitioner Ontario (hereinafter City) acquired alphanumeric pagers able 
to send and receive text messages. Its contract with its service pro­
vider, Arch Wireless, provided for a monthly limit on the number of 
characters each pager could send or receive, and speciﬁed that usage 
exceeding that number would result in an additional fee. The City is­
sued the pagers to respondent Quon and other ofﬁcers in its police 
department (OPD), also a petitioner here. When Quon and others 
exceeded their monthly character limits for several months running, 
petitioner Scharf, OPD’s chief, sought to determine whether the existing 
limit was too low, 
i.
 
e.,
 
whether the ofﬁcers had to pay fees for sending 
work-related messages or, conversely, whether the overages were for 
personal messages. After Arch Wireless provided transcripts of Quon’s 
and another employee’s August and September 2002 text messages, it 
was discovered that many of Quon’s messages were not work related, 
and some were sexually explicit. Scharf referred the matter to OPD’s 
internal affairs division. The investigating ofﬁcer used Quon’s work 
schedule to redact from his transcript any messages he sent while off 
duty, but the transcript showed that few of his on-duty messages related 
to police business. Quon was disciplined for violating OPD rules. 
He and the other respondents—each of whom had exchanged text 
messages with Quon during August and September—ﬁled this suit, al­
leging, 
inter
 
alia,
 
that petitioners violated their Fourth Amendment 
rights and the federal Stored Communications Act (SCA) by obtaining 
and reviewing the transcript of Quon’s pager messages, and that Arch 
Wireless violated the SCA by giving the City the transcript. The Dis­
trict Court denied respondents summary judgment on the constitutional 
claims, relying on the plurality opinion in 
O’Connor
 
v. 
Ortega,
 
480 U. S. 
709, to determine that Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy 
in the content of his messages. Whether the audit was nonetheless 
reasonable, the court concluded, turned on whether Scharf used it for 
the improper purpose of determining if Quon was using his pager to 
waste time, or for the legitimate purpose of determining the efﬁcacy of 
existing character limits to ensure that ofﬁcers were not paying hidden

Syllabus 
work-related costs. After the jury concluded that Scharf’s intent was 
legitimate, the court granted petitioners summary judgment on the 
ground they did not violate the Fourth Amendment. The Ninth Circuit 
reversed. Although it agreed that Quon had a reasonable expectation 
of privacy in his text messages, the appeals court concluded that the 
search was not reasonable even though it was conducted on a legitimate, 
work-related rationale. The opinion pointed to a host of means less 
intrusive than the audit that Scharf could have used. The court further 
concluded that Arch Wireless had violated the SCA by giving the City 
the transcript. 
Held:
 
Because the search of Quon’s text messages was reasonable, peti­
tioners did not violate respondents’ Fourth Amendment rights, and the 
Ninth Circuit erred by concluding otherwise. Pp. 755–765.

The Amendment guarantees a person’s privacy, dignity, and secu­
rity against arbitrary and invasive governmental acts, without regard 
to whether the government actor is investigating crime or performing 
another function.

Raab,
 
489 U. S. 
656, 665. The Members of the 
O’Connor
 
Court disagreed on the proper 
analytical framework for Fourth Amendment claims against govern­
ment employers. A four-Justice plurality concluded that the correct 
analysis has two steps. First, because “some government ofﬁces may 
b es oo p e n... 
that no expectation of privacy is reasonable,” a court 
must consider “[t]he operational realities of the workplace” to determine 
if an employee’s constitutional rights are implicated. 480 U. S., at 718, 
717. 
Second, where an employee has a legitimate privacy expectation, 
an employer’s intrusion on that expectation “for noninvestigatory, 
work-related purposes, as well as for investigations of work-related mis­
conduct, should be judged by the standard of reasonableness under all 
the circumstances.” 
Id.,
 
at 725–726. 
Justice
 
Scalia,
 
concurring in 
the judgment, would have dispensed with the “operational realities” in­
quiry and concluded “that the ofﬁces of government employees . . . are 
[generally] covered by Fourth Amendment protections,” 
id.,
 
at 731, but 
he would also have held “that government searches to retrieve work-
related materials or to investigate violations of workplace rules— 
searches of the sort that are regarded as reasonable and normal in the 
private-employer context—do not violate th
e... 
Amendment,” 
id.,
 
at 
732. 
Pp. 755–757. 
(b) 
Even assuming that Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy 
in his text messages, the search was reasonable under both 
O’Connor
 
approaches, the plurality’s and 
Justice
 
Scalia
’s. Pp. 758–765. 


748 
ONTARIO 
v.
 
QUON 
Syllabus 
(1) 
The Court does not resolve the parties’ disagreement over 
Quon’s privacy expectation. Prudence counsels caution before the facts 
in this case are used to establish far-reaching premises that deﬁne the 
existence, and extent, of privacy expectations of employees using 
employer-provided communication devices. Rapid changes in the dy­
namics of communication and information transmission are evident not 
just in the technology itself but in what society accepts as proper behav­
ior. At present, it is uncertain how workplace norms, and the law’s 
treatment of them, 
will e
volve. Because it is therefore preferable to 
dispose of this case on narrower grounds, the Court assumes, 
arguendo,
 
that: (1) Quon had a reasonable privacy expectation; (2) petitioners’ re­
view of the transcript constituted a Fourth Amendment search; and 
(3) 
the principles applicable to a government employer’s search of an 
employee’s physical ofﬁce apply as well in the electronic sphere. 
Pp. 758–760. 
(2) 
Petitioners’ warrantless review of Quon’s pager transcript was 
reasonable under the 
O’Connor
 
plurality’s approach because it was moti­
vated by a legitimate work-related purpose, and because it was not 
excessive in scope. See 480 U. S., at 726. There were “reasonable 
grounds for [ﬁnding it] necessary for a noninvestigatory work-related 
purpose,” 
ibid.,
 
in that Chief Scharf had ordered the audit to determine 
whether the City’s contractual character limit was sufﬁcient to meet the 
City’s needs. It was also “ ‘reasonably related to the objectives of the 
search,’ ” 
ibid.,
 
because both the City and OPD had a legitimate interest 
in ensuring that employees were not being forced to pay out of their 
own pockets for work-related expenses, or, on the other hand, that the 
City was not paying for extensive personal communications. Review­
ing the transcripts was an efﬁcient and expedient way to determine 
whether either of these factors caused Quon’s overages. And the re­
view was also not “ ‘excessively intrusive.’ ” 
Ibid.
 
Although Quon had 
exceeded his monthly allotment a number of times, OPD requested tran­
scripts for only August and September 2002 in order to obtain a large 
enough sample to decide the character limits’ efﬁcaciousness, and all the 
messages that Quon sent while off duty were redacted. And from 
OPD’s perspective, the fact that Quon likely had only a limited privacy 
expectation lessened the risk that the review would intrude on highly 
private details of Quon’s life. Similarly, because the City had a legiti­
mate reason for the search and it was not excessively intrusive in light 
of that justiﬁcation, the search would be “regarded as reasonable and 
normal in the private-employer context” and thereby satisfy the ap­
proach of 
Justice
 
Scalia
’s concurrence, 
id.,
 
at 732. Conversely, the 
Ninth Circuit’s “least intrusive” means approach was inconsistent with

Whether the other respondents can have a reasonable expectation 
of privacy in their text messages to Quon need not be resolved. They 
argue that because the search was unreasonable as to Quon, it was also 
unreasonable as to them, but they make no corollary argument that the 
search, if reasonable as to Quon, could nonetheless be unreasonable as 
to them. Given this litigating position and the Court’s conclusion that 
the search was reasonable as to Quon, these other respondents cannot 
prevail. P. 765.

delivered the opinion of the Court. 
This case involves the assertion by a government em­
ployer of the right, in circumstances to be described, to read 
text messages sent and received on a pager the employer 
owned and issued to an employee. The employee contends 
that the privacy of the messages is protected by the ban on 
“unreasonable searches and seizures” found in the Fourth 
Amendment to the United States Constitution, made applica­
ble to the States by the Due Process Clause of the Four­
teenth Amendment.

v. 
Ohio,
 
367 U. S. 643 (1961). 
Though the case touches issues of far-reaching signiﬁcance, 
the Court concludes it can be resolved by settled principles 
determining when a search is reasonable. 
I 
A 
The city of Ontario (City) is a political subdivision of the 
State of California. The case arose out of incidents in 2001 
and 2002 when respondent Jeff Quon was employed by the 
Ontario Police Department (OPD). He was a police ser­
geant and member of OPD’s Special Weapons and Tactics 
(SWAT) Team. The City, OPD, and OPD’s Chief, Lloyd 
Scharf, are petitioners here. As will be discussed, two re­
spondents share the last name Quon. In this opinion “Quon” 
refers to Jeff Quon, for the relevant events mostly revolve 
around him. 
In October 2001, the City acquired 20 alphanumeric pagers 
capable of sending and receiving text messages. Arch Wire­
less Operating Company provided wireless service for the 
pagers. Under the City’s service contract with Arch Wire­
less, each pager was allotted a limited number of characters

Opinion of the Court 
sent or received each month. Usage in excess of that 
amount would result in an additional fee. The City issued 
pagers to Quon and other SWAT Team members in order to 
help the SWAT Team mob
ilize and 
respond to emergency 
situations. 
Before acquiring the pagers, the City announced a “Com­
puter Usage, Internet and E-Mail Policy” (Computer Policy) 
that applied to all employees. Among other provisions, it 
speciﬁed that the City “reserves the right to monitor and log 
all network activity including e-mail and Internet use, with 
or without notice. Users should have no expectation of pri­
vacy or conﬁdentiality when using these resources.” App. 
to Pet. for Cert. 151, 152. In March 2000, Quon signed a 
statement acknowledging that he had read and understood 
the Computer Policy. 
The Computer Policy did not apply, on its face, to text 
messaging. Text messages share similarities with e-mails, 
but the two differ in an important way. In this case, for 
instance, an e-mail sent on a City computer was transmitted 
through the City’s own data servers, but a text message sent 
on one of the City’s pagers was transmitted using wireless 
radio frequencies from an individual pager to a receiving sta­
tion owned by Arch Wireless. It was routed through Arch 
Wireless’ computer network, where it remained until the re­
cipient’s pager or cellular telephone was ready to receive the 
message, at which point Arch Wireless transmitted the mes­
sage from the transmitting station nearest to the recipient. 
After delivery, Arch Wireless retained a copy on its com­
puter servers. The message did not pass through comput­
ers owned by the City. 
Although the Computer Policy did not cover text messages 
by its explicit terms, the City made clear to employees, in­
cluding Quon, that the City would treat text messages the 
same way as it treated e-mails. At an April 18, 2002, staff 
meeting at which Quon was present, Lieutenant Steven 
Duke, the OPD ofﬁcer responsible for the City’s contract 


752 
ONTARIO 
v.
 
QUON 
Opinion of the Court 
with Arch Wireless, told ofﬁcers that messages sent on the 
pagers “are considered e-mail messages. This means that 
[text] messages would fall under the City’s policy as public 
information and [would be] eligible for auditing.” App. 30. 
Duke’s comments were put in writing in a memorandum sent 
on April 29, 2002, by Chief Scharf to Quon and other City 
personnel. 
Within the ﬁrst or second b
illing 
cycle after the pagers 
were distributed, Quon exceeded his monthly text message 
character allotment. Duke told Quon about the overage, 
and reminded him that messages sent on the pagers were 
“considered e-mail and could be audited.” 
Id.,
 
at 40. Duke 
said, however, that “it was not his intent to audit [an] em­
ployee’s text messages to see if the overage [was] due to 
work related transmissions.” 
Ibid.
 
Duke suggested that 
Quon could reimburse the City for the overage fee rather 
than have Duke audit the messages. Quon wrote a check to 
the City for the overage. Duke offered the same arrange­
ment to other employees who incurred overage fees. 
Over the next few months, Quon exceeded his character 
limit three or four times. Each time he reimbursed the City. 
Quon and another ofﬁcer again incurred overage fees for 
their pager usage in August 2002. At a meeting in October, 
Duke told Scharf that he had become “ ‘tired of being a 
bill collector.’ ” 
Id.,
 
at 91. Scharf decided to determine 
whether the existing character limit was too low—that is, 
whether ofﬁcers such as Quon were having to pay fees for 
sending work-related messages—or if the overages were for 
personal messages. Scharf told Duke to request transcripts 
of text messages sent in August and September by Quon 
and the other employee who had exceeded the character 
allowance. 
At Duke’s request, an administrative assistant employed 
by OPD contacted Arch Wireless. After verifying that the 
City was the subscriber on the accounts, Arch Wireless pro­
vided the desired transcripts. Duke reviewed the tran­

Opinion of the Court 
scripts and discovered that many of the messages sent and 
received on Quon’s pager were not work related, and some 
were sexually explicit. Duke reported his findings to 
Scharf, who, along with Quon’s immediate supervisor, re­
viewed the transcripts himself. After his review, Scharf re­
ferred the matter to OPD’s internal affairs division for an 
investigation into whether Quon was violating OPD rules by 
pursuing personal matters while on duty. 
The ofﬁcer in charge of the internal affairs review was 
Sergeant Patrick McMahon. Before conducting a review, 
McMahon used Quon’s work schedule to redact the tran­
scripts in order to eliminate any messages Quon sent while 
off duty. He then reviewed the content of the messages 
Quon sent during work hours. McMahon’s report noted that 
Quon sent or received 456 messages during work hours in 
the month of August 2002, of which no more than 57 were 
work related; he sent as many as 80 messages during a single 
day at work; and on an average workday, Quon sent or re­
ceived 28 messages, of which only 3 were related to police 
business. The report concluded that Quon had violated 
OPD rules. Quon was allegedly disciplined.

the Central District of California. Arch Wireless and an in­

Quon was joined in his suit by another plaintiff who is not a 
party before this Court and by the other respondents, each 
of whom exchanged text messages with Quon during August 
and September 2002: Jerilyn Quon, Jeff Quon’s then-wife, 
from whom he was separated; April Florio, an OPD em­
ployee with whom Jeff Quon was romantically involved; and 
Steve Trujillo, another member of the OPD SWAT Team.

Opinion of the Court 
Among the allegations in the complaint was that petitioners 
violated respondents’ Fourth Amendment rights and the 
SCA by obtaining and reviewing the transcript of Jeff Quon’s 
pager messages and that Arch Wireless had violated the 
SCA by turning over the transcript to the City. 
The parties ﬁled cross-motions for summary judgment. 
The District Court granted Arch Wireless’ motion for sum­
mary judgment on the SCA claim but denied petitioners’ mo­
tion for summary judgment on the Fourth Amendment 
claims.

O’Connor
 
v. 
Ortega,
 
480 U. S. 709, 711 (1987), the District 
Court determined that Quon had a reasonable expectation of 
privacy in the content of his text messages. Whether the 
audit of the text messages was nonetheless reasonable, the 
District Court concluded, turned on Chief Scharf’s intent: 
“[I]f the purpose for the audit was to determine if Quon was 
using his pager to ‘play games’ and ‘waste time,’ then the 
audit was not constitutionally reasonable”; but if the audit’s 
purpose “was to determine the efﬁcacy of the existing char­
acter limits to ensure that ofﬁcers were not paying hidden 
work-related costs, 
...n o 
constitutional violation occurred.” 
445 F. Supp. 2d, at 1146. 
The District Court held a jury trial to determine the pur­
pose of the audit. The jury concluded that Scharf ordered 
the audit to determine the efﬁcacy of the character limits. 
The District Court accordingly held that petitioners did not 
violate the Fourth Amendment. It entered judgment in 
their favor.

reversed in part.

cacy of the 25,000 character limit . . . without intruding on 
[respondents’] Fourth Amendment rights.” 
Id.,
 
at 908–909. 
The opinion pointed to a “host of simple ways” that the chief 
could have used instead of the audit, such as warning Quon 
at the beginning of the month that his future messages 
would be audited, or asking Quon himself to redact the tran­
script of his messages. 
Id.,
 
at 909. The Court of Appeals 
further concluded that Arch Wireless had violated the SCA 
by turning over the transcript to the City.

The Fourth Amendment states: “The right of the people

The 
O’Connor
 
Court did disagree on the proper analytical 
framework for Fourth Amendment claims against govern­
ment employers. A four-Justice plurality concluded that the 
correct analysis has two steps. First, because “some gov­
ernment ofﬁces may be so open to fellow employees or the 
public that no expectation of privacy is reasonable,” 
id.,
 
at 
718, a court must consider “[t]he operational realities of the 
workplace” in order to determine whether an employee’s 
Fourth Amendment rights are implicated, 
id.,
 
at 717. On 
this view, “the question whether an employee has a reason­

Cite as: 560 U. S. 746 (2010) 
Opinion of the Court 
able expectation of privacy must be addressed on a case-by­
case basis.” 
Id.,
 
at 718. Next, where an employee has a 
legitimate privacy expectation, an employer’s intrusion on 
that expectation “for noninvestigatory, work-related pur­
poses, as well as for investigations of work-related miscon­
duct, should be judged by the standard of reasonableness 
under all the circumstances.” 
Id.,
 
at 725–726. 
Justice
 
Scalia,
 
concurring in the judgment, outlined a 
different approach. His opinion would have dispensed with 
an inquiry into “operational realities” and would conclude 
“that the ofﬁces of government employees . . . are covered 
by Fourth Amendment protections as a general matter.” 
Id.,
 
at 731. But he would also have held “that government 
searches to retrieve work-related materials or to investigate 
violations of workplace rules—searches of the sort that are 
regarded as reasonable and normal in the private-employer 
context—do not violate the Fourth Amendment.” 
Id.,
 
at 732. 
Later, in the 
Von
 
Raab
 
decision, the Court explained that 
“operational realities” could diminish an employee’s privacy 
expectations, and that this diminution could be taken into 
consideration when assessing the reasonableness of a work­
place search. 489 U. S., at 671. In the two decades since 
O’Connor,
 
however, the threshold test for determining the 
scope of an employee’s Fourth Amendment rights has not 
been clarified further. Here, though they disagree on 
whether Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy, both 
petitioners and respondents start from the premise that 
the 
O’Connor
 
plurality controls. See Brief for Petitioners 
22–28; Brief for Respondents 25–32. It is not necessary to 
resolve whether that premise is correct. The case can be 
decided by determining that the search was reasonable even 
assuming Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy. 
The two 
O’Connor
 
approaches—the plurality’s and 
Justice
 
Scalia
’s—therefore lead to the same result here.

ONTARIO 
v.
 
QUON 
Opinion of the Court 
III
 
A
 
Before turning to the reasonableness of the search, it is 
instructive to note the parties’ disagreement over whether 
Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy. The record 
does establish that OPD, at the outset, made it clear that 
pager messages were not considered private. The City’s 
Computer Policy stated that “[u]sers should have no expecta­
tion of privacy or conﬁdentiality when using” City comput­
ers. App. to Pet. for Cert. 152. Chief Scharf’s memo and 
Duke’s statements made clear that this ofﬁcial policy ex­
tended to text messaging. The disagreement, at least as re­
spondents see the case, is over whether Duke’s later state­
ments overrode the ofﬁcial policy. Respondents contend 
that because Duke told Quon that an audit would be unneces­
sary if Quon paid for the overage, Quon reasonably could 
expect that the contents of his messages would remain 
private. 
At this point, were we to assume that inquiry into “opera­
tional realities” were called for, compare 
O’Connor,
 
480 U. S., 
at 717 (plurality opinion), with 
id.,
 
at 730–731 (opinion of 
Scalia,
 
J.); see also 
id.,
 
at 737–738 (Blackmun, J., dissenting), 
it would be necessary to ask whether Duke’s statements 
could be taken as announcing a change in OPD policy, and if 
so, whether he had, in fact or appearance, the authority to 
make such a change and to guarantee the privacy of text 
messaging. It would also be necessary to consider whether 
a review of messages sent on police pagers, particularly 
those sent while ofﬁcers are on duty, might be justiﬁed for 
other reasons, including performance evaluations, litigation 
concerning the lawfulness of police actions, and perhaps com­
pliance with state open records laws. See Brief for Petition­
ers 35–40 (citing Cal. Public Records Act, Cal. Govt. Code 
Ann. § 6250 
et
 
seq.
 
(West 2008)). These matters would all 
bear on the legitimacy of an employee’s privacy expectation.

Opinion of the Court 
The Court must proceed with care when considering the 
whole concept of privacy expectations in communications 
made on electronic equipment owned by a government em­
ployer. The judiciary risks error by elaborating too fully on 
the Fourth Amendment implications of emerging technology 
before its role in society has become clear. See, 
e.
 
g.,
 
Olm­
stead
 
v. 
United
 
States,
 
277 U. S. 438 (1928), overruled by 
Katz
 
v. 
United
 
States,
 
389 U. S. 347, 353 (1967). In 
Katz,
 
the Court relied on its own knowledge and experience to 
conclude that there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in 
a telephone booth. See 
id.,
 
at 360–361 (Harlan, J., concur­
ring). It is not so clear that courts at present are on so sure 
a ground. Prudence counsels caution before the facts in the 
instant case are used to establish far-reaching premises that 
deﬁne the existence, and extent, of privacy expectations 
enjoyed by employees when using employer-provided com­
munication devices. 
Rapid changes in the dynamics of communication and in­
formation transmission are evident not just in the technology 
itself but in what society accepts as proper behavior. As 
one 
amici
 
brief notes, many employers expect or at least 
tolerate personal use of such equipment by employees be­
cause it often increases worker efﬁciency. See Brief for 
Electronic Frontier Foundation et al. 16–20. Another 
ami­
cus
 
points out that the law is beginning to respond to these 
developments, as some States have recently passed statutes 
requiring employers to notify employees when monitoring 
their electronic communications. See Brief for New York 
Intellectual Property Law Association 22 (citing Del. Code 
Ann., Tit. 19, § 705 (2005); Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 31–48d 
(West 2003)). At present, it is uncertain how workplace 
norms, and the law’s treatment of them, will evolve. 
Even if the Court were certain that the 
O’Connor
 
plural­
ity’s approach were the right one, the Court would have dif­
ﬁculty predicting how employees’ privacy expectations will 
be shaped by those changes or the degree to which society 


760 
ONTARIO 
v.
 
QUON 
Opinion of the Court 
will be prepared to recognize those expectations as reason­
able. See 480 U. S., at 715. Cell phone and text message 
communications are so pervasive that some persons may con­
sider them to be essential means or necessary instruments 
for self-expression, even self-identification. That might 
strengthen the case for an expectation of privacy. On the 
other hand, the ubiquity of those devices has made them gen­
erally affordable, so one could counter that employees who 
need cell phones or similar devices for personal matters can 
purchase and pay for their own. And employer policies con­
cerning communications will of course shape the reasonable 
expectations of their employees, especially to the extent that 
such policies are clearly communicated. 
A broad holding concerning employees’ privacy expecta­
tions vis-a
`
-vis employer-provided technological equipment 
might have implications for future cases that cannot be pre­
dicted. It is preferable to dispose of this case on narrower 
grounds. For present purposes we assume several proposi­
tions, 
arguendo:
 
First, Quon had a reasonable expectation of 
privacy in the text messages sent on the pager provided to 
him by the City; second, petitioners’ review of the transcript 
constituted a search within the meaning of the Fourth 
Amendment; and third, the principles applicable to a govern­
ment employer’s search of an employee’s physical ofﬁce apply 
with at least the same force when the employer intrudes on 
the employee’s privacy in the electronic sphere. 
B 
Even if Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in 
his text messages, petitioners did not necessarily violate the 
Fourth Amendment by obtaining and reviewing the tran­
scripts. Although as a general matter, warrantless searches 
“are 
per
 
se
 
unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment,” 
there are “a few speciﬁcally established and well-delineated 
exceptions” to that general rule. 
Katz,
 
supra,
 
at 357. The 
Court has held that the “ ‘special needs’ ” of the workplace

justify one such exception.

at 732 (
Scalia,
 
J., concurring in judg­
ment); 
Von
 
Raab,
 
489 U. S., at 666–667. 
Under the approach of the 
O’Connor
 
plurality, when con­
ducted for a “noninvestigatory, work-related purpos[e]” or 
for the “investigatio[n] of work-related misconduct,” a gov­
ernment employer’s warrantless search is reasonable if it is 
“ ‘justiﬁed at its inception’ ” and if “ ‘the measures adopted 
are reasonably related to the objectives of the search and not 
excessively intrusive in light of’ ” the circumstances giving 
rise to the search. 480 U. S., at 725–726. The search here 
satisﬁed the standard of the 
O’Connor
 
plurality and was rea­
sonable under that approach. 
The search was justiﬁed at its inception because there 
were “reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search 
[was] necessary for a noninvestigatory work-related pur­
pose.” 
Id.,
 
at 726. As a jury found, Chief Scharf ordered 
the search in order to determine whether the character limit 
on the City’s contract with Arch Wireless was sufﬁcient to 
meet the City’s needs. This was, as the Ninth Circuit noted, 
a “legitimate work-related rationale.” 529 F. 3d, at 908. 
The City and OPD had a legitimate interest in ensuring 
that employees were not being forced to pay out of their 
own pockets for work-related expenses, or on the other 
hand that the City was not paying for extensive personal 
communications. 
As for the scope of the search, reviewing the transcripts 
was reasonable because it was an efﬁcient and expedient way 
to determine whether Quon’s overages were the result of 
work-related messaging or personal use. The review was 
also not “ ‘excessively intrusive.’ ” 
O’Connor,
 
supra,
 
at 
726 (plurality opinion). Although Quon had gone over his 
monthly allotment a number of times, OPD requested tran­
scripts for only the months of August and September 2002. 
While it may have been reasonable as well for OPD to review 
transcripts of all the months in which Quon exceeded his 


762 
ONTARIO 
v.
 
QUON 
Opinion of the Court 
allowance, it was certainly reasonable for OPD to review 
messages for just two months in order to obtain a large 
enough sample to decide whether the character limits were 
efﬁcacious. And it is worth noting that during his internal 
affairs investigation, McMahon redacted all messages Quon 
sent while off duty, a measure which reduced the intrusive­
ness of any further review of the transcripts. 
Furthermore, and again on the assumption that Quon had 
a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of his 
messages, the extent of an expectation is relevant to assess­
ing whether the search was too intrusive. See 
Von
 
Raab,
 
supra,
 
at 671; cf. 
Vernonia
 
School
 
Dist.
 
47J
 
v. 
Acton,
 
515 
U. 
S. 646, 654–657 (1995). Even if he could assume some 
level of privacy would inhere in his messages, it would not 
have been reasonable for Quon to conclude that his messages 
were in all circumstances immune from scrutiny. Quon was 
told that his messages were subject to auditing. As a law 
enforcement ofﬁcer, he would or should have known that his 
actions were likely to come under legal scrutiny, and that 
this might entail an analysis of his on-the-job communica­
tions. Under the circumstances, a reasonable employee 
would be aware that sound management principles might re­
quire the audit of messages to determine whether the pager 
was being appropriately used. Given that the City issued 
the pagers to Quon and other SWAT Team members in order 
to help them more quickly respond to crises—and given that 
Quon had received no assurances of privacy—Quon could 
have anticipated that it might be necessary for the City to 
audit pager messages to assess the SWAT Team’s perform­
ance in particular emergency situations. 
From OPD’s perspective, the fact that Quon likely had only 
a limited privacy expectation, with boundaries that we need 
not here explore, lessened the risk that the review would 
intrude on highly private details of Quon’s life. OPD’s audit 
of messages on Quon’s employer-provided pager was not 
nearly as intrusive as a search of his personal e-mail account 


763 
Cite as: 560 U. S. 746 (2010) 
Opinion of the Court 
or pager, or a wiretap on his home phone line, would have 
been. That the search did reveal intimate details of Quon’s 
life does not make it unreasonable, for under the circum­
stances a reasonable employer would not expect that such 
a review would intrude on such matters. The search was 
permissible in its scope. 
The Court of Appeals erred in ﬁnding the search unreason­
able. It pointed to a “host of simple ways to verify the efﬁ­
cacy of the 25,000 character limit . . . without intruding on 
[respondents’] Fourth Amendment rights.” 529 F. 3d, at 
909. 
The panel suggested that Scharf “could have warned 
Quon that for the month of September he was forbidden from 
using his pager for personal communications, and that the 
contents of all of his messages would be reviewed to ensure 
the pager was used only for work-related purposes during 
that timeframe. Alternatively, if [OPD] wanted to review 
past usage, it could have asked Quon to count the characters 
himself, or asked him to redact personal messages and grant 
permission to [OPD] to review the redacted transcript.” 
Ibid.
 
This approach was inconsistent with contro
lling 
prece­
dents. This Court has “repeatedly refused to declare that 
only the ‘least intrusive’ search practicable can be reasonable 
under the Fourth Amendment.”

the Court of Appeals in this case illustrate the necessity of 


764

v.
 
QUON 
Opinion of the Court 
this principle. Even assuming there were ways that OPD 
could have performed the search that would have been less 
intrusive, it does not follow that the search as conducted 
was unreasonable. 
Respondents argue that the search was 
per
 
se
 
unreason­
able in light of the Court of Appeals’ conclusion that Arch 
Wireless violated the SCA by giving the City the transcripts 
of Quon’s text messages. The merits of the SCA claim are 
not before us. But even if the Court of Appeals was correct 
to conclude that the SCA forbade Arch Wireless from turn­
ing over the transcripts, it does not follow that petitioners’ 
actions were unreasonable. Respondents point to no au­
thority for the proposition that the existence of statutory 
protection renders a search 
per
 
se
 
unreasonable under the 
Fourth Amendment. And the precedents counsel other­
wise. See 
Virginia
 
v. 
Moore,
 
553 U. S. 164, 168 (2008) 
(search incident to an arrest that was illegal under state law 
was reasonable); 
California
 
v. 
Greenwood,
 
486 U. S. 35, 43 
(1988) (rejecting argument that if state law forbade police 
search of individual’s garbage the search would violate the 
Fourth Amendment). Furthermore, respondents do not 
maintain that any OPD employee either violated the law 
himself or herself or knew or should have known that Arch 
Wireless, by turning over the transcript, would have violated 
the law. The otherwise reasonable search by OPD is not 
rendered unreasonable by the assumption that Arch Wire­
less violated the SCA by turning over the transcripts. 
Because the search was motivated by a legitimate work-
related purpose, and because it was not excessive in scope, 
the search was reasonable under the approach of the 
O’Con­
nor
 
plurality. 480 U. S., at 726. For these same reasons— 
that the employer had a legitimate reason for the search, and 
that the search was not excessively intrusive in light of that 
justiﬁcation—the Court also concludes that the search would 
be “regarded as reasonable and normal in the private-
employer context” and would satisfy the approach of

at 732. The search was 
reasonable, and the Court of Appeals erred by holding to the 
contrary. Petitioners did not violate Quon’s Fourth Amend­
ment rights. 
C 
Finally, the Court must consider whether the search vio­
lated the Fourth Amendment rights of Jerilyn Quon, Florio, 
and Trujillo, the respondents who sent text messages to Jeff 
Quon. Petitioners and respondents disagree whether a 
sender of a text message can have a reasonable expectation 
of privacy in a message he knowingly sends to someone’s 
employer-provided pager. It is not necessary to resolve this 
question in order to dispose of the case, however. Respond­
ents argue that because “the search was unreasonable as to 
Sergeant Quon, it was also unreasonable as to his correspon­
dents.” Brief for Respondents 60 (some capitalization omit­
ted; boldface deleted). They make no corollary argument 
that the search, if reasonable as to Quon, could nonetheless 
be unreasonable as to Quon’s correspondents. See 
id.,
 
at 
65–66. In light of this litigating position and the Court’s 
conclusion that the search was reasonable as to Jeff Quon, 
it necessarily follows that these other respondents cannot 
prevail. 
* * * 
Because the search was reasonable, petitioners did not vio­
late respondents’ Fourth Amendment rights, and the court 
below erred by concluding otherwise. The judgment of the

Stevens,
 
J., concurring 
480 U. S. 709 (1987), provides the correct approach to deter­
mining an employee’s reasonable expectation of privacy. 
See 
ante,
 
at 757. Justice Blackmun, writing for the four dis­
senting Justices in 
O’Connor,
 
agreed with 
Justice
 
Scalia
 
that an employee enjoys a reasonable expectation of privacy 
in his ofﬁce. 480 U. S., at 737. But he advocated a third 
approach to the reasonable expectation of privacy inquiry, 
separate from those proposed by the 
O’Connor
 
plurality and 
by 
Justice
 
Scalia,
 
see 
ante,
 
at 756–757. Recognizing that 
it is particularly important to safeguard “a public employee’s 
expectation of privacy in the workplace” in light of the “real­
ity of work in modern time,” 480 U. S., at 739, which lacks 
“tidy distinctions” between workplace and private activities, 
ibid.,
 
Justice Blackmun argued that “the precise extent of an 
employee’s expectation of privacy often turns on the nature 
of the search,” 
id.,
 
at 738. And he emphasized that courts 
should determine this expectation in light of the speciﬁc 
facts of each particular search, rather than by announcing a 
categorical standard. See 
id.,
 
at 741. 
For the reasons stated at page 762 of the Court’s opinion, 
it is clear that respondent Jeff Quon, as a law enforcement 
ofﬁcer who served on a SWAT Team, should have understood 
that all of his work-related actions—including all of his com­
munications on his ofﬁcial pager—were likely to be subject 
to public and legal scrutiny. He therefore had only a limited 
expectation of privacy in relation to this particular audit of 
his pager messages. Whether one applies the reasoning

Scalia,
 
concurring in part and concurring in the

I join the Court’s opinion except for Part III–A. 
I continue to believe that the “operational realities” rubric

lic employees invented by the plurality in 
O’Connor
 
v.

tega,
 
480 U. S. 709, 717 (1987), is standardless and unsup­
ported. 
Id.,
 
at 729–732 (
Scalia,
 
J., concurring in judgment). 
In this case, the proper threshold inquiry should be not 
whether the Fourth Amendment applies to messages on 
pub­
lic
 
employees’ employer-issued pagers, but whether it ap­
plies 
in
 
general
 
to such messages on employer-issued pagers. 
See 
id.,
 
at 731. 
Here, however, there is no need to answer that threshold 
question. Even accepting at face value Quon’s and his co-
plaintiffs’ claims that the Fourth Amendment applies to their 
messages, the city’s search was reasonable, and thus did not 
violate the Amendment. See 
id.,
 
at 726 (plurality opinion); 
id.,
 
at 732 (
Scalia,
 
J., concurring in judgment). Since it is un­
necessary to decide whether the Fourth Amendment applies, 
it is unnecessary to resolve which approach in 
O’Connor
 
con­
trols: the plurality’s or mine.† That should end the matter. 
732 (dissenting opinion), whereas a majority of the Court rejected that 
view, see 
id.,
 
at 722, 725 (plurality opinion); 
id.,
 
at 732 (
Scalia,
 
J., concur­
ring in judgment). It was that analysis—regarding the proper standard 
for evaluating a search when an employee has a reasonable expectation of 
privacy—that produced the opposite result in the case. This case does 
not implicate that debate because it does not involve an investiga­
tory search. The jury concluded that the purpose of the audit was to 
determine whether the character limits were sufﬁcient for work-related 
messages. See

Opinion of

The Court concedes as much, 
ante,
 
at 757, 760–765, yet it 
inexplicably interrupts its analysis with a recitation of the 
parties’ arguments concerning, and an excursus on the com­
plexity and consequences of answering, that admittedly irrel­
evant threshold question, 
ante,
 
at 758–760. That discussion 
is unnecessary. (To whom do we owe an 
additional
 
ex­
planation for declining to decide an issue, once we have 
explained that it makes no difference?) It also seems to 
me exaggerated. Applying the Fourth Amendment to new 
technologies may sometimes be difﬁcult, but when it is neces­
sary to decide a case we have no choice. The Court’s impli­
cation, 
ante,
 
at 759, that where electronic privacy is con­
cerned we should decide less than we otherwise would (that 
is, less than the principle of law necessary to resolve the 
case and guide private action)—or that we should hedge our 
bets by concocting case-speciﬁc standards or issuing opaque 
opinions—is in my view indefensible. The-times-they-are­
a-changin’ is a feeble excuse for disregard of duty. 
Worse still, the digression is self-defeating. Despite the 
Court’s insistence that it is agnostic about the proper test, 
lower courts will likely read the Court’s self-described “in­
structive” expatiation on how the 
O’Connor
 
plurality’s ap­
proach would apply here (if it applied), 
ante,
 
at 758–760, as 
a heavy-handed hint about how 
they
 
should proceed. Liti­
gants will do likewise, using the threshold question whether 
the Fourth Amendment is even implicated as a basis for bom­
barding lower courts with arguments about employer poli­
cies, how they were communicated, and whether they were 
authorized, as well as the latest trends in employees’ use of 
ard. There is room for reasonable debate as to which of the two ap­
proaches advocated by Justices whose votes supported the judgment in 
O’Connor
—the plurality’s and mine—is controlling under 
Marks
 
v. 
United
 
States,
 
430 U. S. 188, 193 (1977). But unless 
O’Connor
 
is overruled, it is 
assuredly false that a test that would have produced the 
opposite
 
result 
in that case is still in the running.

electronic media. In short, in saying why it is not saying 
more, the Court says much more than it should. 
The Court’s inadvertent boosting of the 
O’Connor
 
plural­
ity’s standard is all the more ironic because, in ﬂeshing out 
its fears that applying that test to new technologies will be 
too hard, the Court underscores the unworkability of that 
standard. Any rule that requires evaluating whether a 
given gadget is a “necessary instrumen[t] for self-expression, 
even self-identiﬁcation,” on top of assessing the degree to 
which “the law’s treatment of [workplace norms has] 
evolve[d],” 
ante,
 
at 759–760, is (to put it mildly) unlikely to 
yield objective answers. 
I concur in the Court’s judgment.
