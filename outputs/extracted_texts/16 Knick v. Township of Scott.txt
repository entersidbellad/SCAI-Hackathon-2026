KNICK v. TOWNSHIP OF SCOTT, PENNSYLVANIA, ET 
AL. 
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR 
THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
No. 17–647. Argued October 3, 2018—Reargued January 16, 2019—
Decided June 21, 2019 
The Township of Scott, Pennsylvania, passed an ordinance requiring 
that “[a]ll cemeteries . . . be kept open and accessible to the general 
public during daylight hours.”  Pe titioner Rose Mary Knick, whose 
90-acre rural property has a small family graveyard, was notified 
that she was violating the ordinanc e.  Knick sought declaratory and 
injunctive relief in state court on the ground that the ordinance ef-
fected a taking of her property, but she did not bring an inverse con-
demnation action under state law seeking compensation.  The Town-
ship responded by withdrawing the violation notice and staying 
enforcement of the ordinance.  Wi thout an ongoing enforcement ac -
tion, the court held, Knick could not demonstrate the irreparable 
harm necessary for equitable relief, so it declined to rule on her re-
quest.  Knick then filed an action in Federal District Court under 42 
U. S. C. §1983, alleging that the ordinance violated the Takings 
Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  The District Court dismissed her 
claim under Williamson County Regional Planning Comm’n v. Ham-
ilton Bank of Johnson City , 473 U. S. 172, which held that property 
owners must seek just compensati on under state law in state court 
before bringing a federal takings claim under §1983. The Third Cir-
cuit affirmed. 
Held: 
1. A government violates the Taki ngs Clause when it takes proper-
ty without compensation, and a pr operty owner may bring a Fifth 
Amendment claim under §1983 at that time.  Pp. 5–20.
(a) In Williamson County, the Court held that, as relevant here, 
a property developer’s federal takings claim was “premature” because

Syllabus 
he had not sought compensation through the State’s inverse condem-
nation procedure.  473 U. S., at 197.  The unanticipated consequence 
of this ruling was that a takings plaintiff who complied with William-
son County and brought a compensation claim in state court would— 
on proceeding to federal court af ter the unsuccessful state claim—
have the federal claim barred because the full faith and credit statute 
required the federal court to give pr eclusive effect to the state court’s 
decision. San Remo Hotel, L. P. v. City and County of San Francisco , 
545 U. S. 323, 347.  Pp. 5–6.
(b) This Court has long recogn ized that property owners may
bring Fifth Amendment claims for compensation as soon as their
property has been taken, regardle ss of any other post-taking reme-
dies that may be available to the property owner.  See Jacobs v. Unit-
ed States, 290 U. S. 13.  The Court departed from that understanding 
in Williamson County and held that a taking gives rise not to a con-
stitutional right to just compensati on, but instead gives a right to a 
state law procedure that will eventually result in  just compensation. 
Just two years after Williamson County, however, the Court returned 
to its traditional understanding of the Fifth Amendment, holding
that the compensation remedy is re quired by the Constitution in the
event of a taking. First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of 
Glendale v. County of Los Angeles , 482 U. S. 304.  A property owner 
acquires a right to compensation  immediately upon an uncompen-
sated taking because the taking itse lf violates the Fifth Amendment. 
See San Diego Gas & Elec. Co.  v. San Diego , 450 U. S. 621, 654 
(Brennan, J., dissenting).  The prop erty owner may, therefore, bring 
a claim under §1983 for the deprivation of a constitutional right at 
that time.  Pp. 6–12.
(c) Williamson County’s understanding of the Takings Clause 
was drawn from Ruckelshaus  v. Monsanto Co., 467 U. S. 986, where 
the plaintiff sought to enjoin a fe deral statute because it effected a
taking, even though the statute se t up a mandatory arbitration pro-
cedure for obtaining compensation.  Id., at 1018.  That case does not 
support Williamson County, however, because Congress—unlike the 
States—is free to require plaintiffs  to exhaust administrative reme-
dies before bringing constitutional claims.  Williamson County also 
analogized its new state-litigatio n requirement to federal takings 
practice under the Tucker Act, bu t a claim for just compensation 
brought under the Tucker Act is not a prerequisite to a Fifth 
Amendment takings claim—it is a Fifth Amendment takings claim. 
Williamson County  also looked to Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U. S. 527. 
But Parratt was not a takings case at all, and the analogy from the 
due process context to the takings co ntext is strained.  The poor rea-
soning of Williamson County may be partially explained by the cir-

cumstances in which the state-lit igation issue reached the Court, 
which may not have permitted the Court to adequately test the logic 
of the state-litigation requiremen t or consider its implications. 
Pp. 12–16. 
(d) Respondents read too broadly statements in prior opinions
that the Takings Clause “does not provide or require that compensa-
tion shall be actually paid in advance of the occupancy of the land to 
be taken. But the owner is entitl ed to reasonable, certain and ade-
quate provision for obtaining compensation” after a taking.  Cherokee 
Nation v. Southern Kansas R. Co., 135 U. S. 641, 659.  Those state-
ments concerned requests for injuncti ve relief, and the availability of
subsequent compensation meant that such an equitable remedy was 
not available.  Simply because the property owner was not entitled to
injunctive relief at the time of the taking does not mean there was no 
violation of the Takings Clause at that time.  The history of takings 
litigation provides valuable context.  At the time of the founding,
there usually was no compensation  remedy available to property
owners, who could obtain only retr ospective damages, as well as an 
injunction ejecting the government from the property going forward.
But in the 1870s, as state courts began to recognize implied rights of 
action for damages under the st ate equivalents of the Takings
Clause, they declined to grant in junctions because property owners 
had an adequate remedy at law.  Congress enabled property owners
to obtain compensation for taking s by the Federal Government when 
it passed the Tucker Act in 1887, and this Court subsequently joined 
the state courts in holding that th e compensation remedy is required 
by the Takings Clause itself.  Today, because the federal and nearly
all state governments provide just compensation remedies to proper-
ty owners who have suffered a taking, equitable relief is generally 
unavailable.  As long as an adeq uate provision for obtaining just
compensation exists, there is no basis  to enjoin government action ef-
fecting a taking.  Pp. 16–19.
2. The state-litigation requirement of Williamson County  is over-
ruled. Several factors counsel in favor of this decision.  Williamson 
County was poorly reasoned and conflic ts with much of the Court’s 
takings jurisprudence.  Because of  its shaky foundations, the ra-
tionale for the state-litigation requ irement has been repeatedly re-
cast by this Court and the defenders of Williamson County. The 
state-litigation requirement also prov ed to be unworkable in practice 
because the San Remo preclusion trap preven ted takings plaintiffs
from ever bringing their claims in federal court, contrary to the ex-
pectations of the Williamson County Court. Finally, there are no re-
liance interests on the state-litigatio n requirement.  As long as post-
taking compensation remedies are available, governments need not

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
No. 17–647 
ROSE MARY KNICK, PETITIONER v. TOWNSHIP OF 
SCOTT, PENNSYLVANIA, ET AL. 
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 
APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
[June 21, 2019] 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the
Court. 
The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment states that 
“private property [shall not] be taken for public use, with-
out just compensation.”  In Williamson County Regional 
Planning Comm’n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City , 473 
U. S. 172 (1985), we held that a property owner whose 
property has been taken by a local government has not 
suffered a violation of his Fifth Amendment rights—and 
thus cannot bring a federal takings claim in federal
court—until a state court has denied his claim for just 
compensation under state law.
The Williamson County  Court anticipated that if the 
property owner failed to secure just compensation under
state law in state court, he would be able to bring a “ripe” 
federal takings claim in federal court. See id., at 194. But 
as we later held in San Remo Hotel , L. P.  v. City and 
County of San Francisco, 545 U. S. 323 (2005), a state 
court’s resolution of a claim for just compensation under 
state law generally has preclusive effect in any subsequent 
federal suit.  The takings plaintiff thus finds himself in a 

  
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2 KNICK v. TOWNSHIP OF SCOTT 
Opinion of the Court 
Catch-22: He cannot go to fe deral court without going to
state court first; but if he goes to state court and loses, his 
claim will be barred in federal court.  The federal claim 
dies aborning.
The San Remo preclusion trap should tip us off that the
state-litigation requirement re sts on a mistaken view of 
the Fifth Amendment. The Civil Rights Act of 1871, after 
all, guarantees “a federal forum for claims of unconstitu-
tional treatment at the hands of state officials,” and the 
settled rule is that “exhaustion of state remedies ‘is not a 
prerequisite to an action under [42 U. S. C.] §1983.’”  Heck 
v. Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477, 480 (1994) (quoting Patsy v. 
Board of Regents of Fla. , 457 U. S. 496, 501 (1982)).  But 
the guarantee of a federal forum rings hollow for takings 
plaintiffs, who are forced to litigate their claims in state 
court. 
We now conclude that the state-litigation requirement
imposes an unjustifiable burden on takings plaintiffs,
conflicts with the rest of our takings jurisprudence, and 
must be overruled.  A property owner has an actionable
Fifth Amendment takings claim when the government
takes his property without paying for it.  That does not 
mean that the government must provide compensation in 
advance of a taking or risk having its action invalidated:
So long as the property owner has some way to obtain
compensation after the fact, governments need not fear
that courts will enjoin their activities.  But it does mean 
that the property owner has suffered a violation of his 
Fifth Amendment rights when the government takes his 
property without just compensation, and therefore may 
bring his claim in federal court under §1983 at that time.

Petitioner Rose Mary Knick owns 90 acres of land in
Scott Township, Pennsylvania, a small community just
north of Scranton. Knick lives in a single-family home on

Opinion of the Court 
the property and uses the rest of the land as a grazing
area for horses and other farm animals.  The property
includes a small graveyard wher e the ancestors of Knick’s 
neighbors are allegedly buried.  Such family cemeteries
are fairly common in Pennsylvania, where “backyard 
burials” have long been permitted.
In December 2012, the Township passed an ordinance 
requiring that “[a]ll cemeteries . . . be kept open and ac -
cessible to the general public during daylight hours.”  The 
ordinance defined a “cemetery” as “[a] place or area of 
ground, whether contained on private or public property, 
which has been set apart for or otherwise utilized as a 
burial place for deceased human beings.”  The ordinance 
also authorized Township “code  enforcement” officers to 
“enter upon any property” to determine the existence and
location of a cemetery.  App. 21–23.
In 2013, a Township officer found several grave markers
on Knick’s property and notified her that she was violating 
the ordinance by failing to open the cemetery to the public
during the day. Knick responded by seeking declaratory 
and injunctive relief in state court on the ground that the
ordinance effected a taking of her property. Knick did not 
seek compensation for the taking by bringing an “inverse 
condemnation” action under state law.  Inverse condemna-
tion is “a cause of action against a governmental defend-
ant to recover the value of property which has been taken 
in fact by the governmental defendant.”  United States v. 
Clarke, 445 U. S. 253, 257 (1980) (quoting D. Hagman, 
Urban Planning and Land Development Control Law 328
(1971)). Inverse condemnation stands in contrast to direct 
condemnation, in which the government initiates proceed-
ings to acquire title under its eminent domain authority.
Pennsylvania, like every other State besides Ohio, pro-
vides a state inverse condemnation action. 26 Pa. Cons. 

  
 
 
   
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
4 KNICK v. TOWNSHIP OF SCOTT 
Opinion of the Court 
Stat. §502(c) (2009).1 
In response to Knick’s suit, the Township withdrew the
violation notice and agreed to stay enforcement of the 
ordinance during the state court proceedings. The court, 
however, declined to rule on  Knick’s request for declara -
tory and injunctive relief because, without an ongoing en-
forcement action, she could not demonstrate the irrepara-
ble harm necessary for equitable relief.
Knick then filed an action in Federal District Court 
under 42 U. S. C. §1983, alleging that the ordinance vio-
lated the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
2  T he 
District Court dismissed Knick’s takings claim under 
Williamson County because she had not pursued an in-
verse condemnation action in state court. 2016 WL 
4701549, *5–*6 (MD Pa., Sept. 8, 2016). On appeal, the
Third Circuit noted that the ordinance was “extraordinary
and constitutionally suspect,” but affirmed the District 
Court in light of Williamson County . 862 F. 3d 310, 314 
(2017).
We granted certiorari to reconsider the holding of Wil-
liamson County that property owners must seek just
compensation under state law in state court before bring-
ing a federal takings claim under §1983.  583 U. S. ___ 
(2018).

1 A property owner in Ohio who ha s suffered a taking without com-
pensation must seek a writ of mandamus to compel the government to 
initiate condemnation proceedings. See, e.g., State ex rel. Doner v.

Opinion of the Court 
II 
In Williamson County , a property developer brought a
takings claim under §1983 against a zoning board that 
had rejected the developer’s proposal for a new subdivi-
sion. Williamson County  held that the developer’s Fifth
Amendment claim was not “ripe” for two reasons.  First, 
the developer still had an opportunity to seek a variance
from the appeals board, so any taking was therefore not 
yet final. 473 U. S., at 186–194.  Knick does not question
the validity of this finality requirement, which is not at
issue here. 
The second holding of Williamson County  is that the 
developer had no federal takings claim because he had not 
sought compensation “through the procedures the State
ha[d] provided for doing so.”  Id., at 194.  That is the hold-
ing Knick asks us to overrule.  According to the Court, “if a 
State provides an adequate pr ocedure for seeking just
compensation, the property owner cannot claim a violation 
of the [Takings] Clause until it has used the procedure
and been denied just compensation.”  Id. , at 195. The 
Court concluded that the deve loper’s federal takings claim
was “premature” because he had not sought compensation
through the State’s inverse condemnation procedure. Id., 
at 197. 
The unanticipated consequences of this ruling were not 
clear until 20 years later, when this Court decided San 
Remo. In that case, the takings plaintiffs complied with 
Williamson County and brought a claim for compensation 
in state court. 545 U. S., at 331.  The complaint made
clear that the plaintiffs sought relief only under the tak-
ings clause of the State Constitution, intending to reserve
their Fifth Amendment claim for a later federal suit if the 
state suit proved unsuccessful.  Id., at 331–332. When 
that happened, however, and the plaintiffs proceeded to 
federal court, they found that their federal claim was 
barred. This Court held that the full faith and credit 

  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
6 KNICK v. TOWNSHIP OF SCOTT 
Opinion of the Court 
statute, 28 U. S. C. §1738, required the federal court to 
give preclusive effect to the st ate court’s decision, blocking
any subsequent consideration of whether the plaintiff had 
suffered a taking within the meaning of the Fifth Amend-
ment. 545 U. S., at 347.  The adverse state court decision 
that, according to Williamson County , gave rise to a ripe
federal takings claim simultaneously barred that claim,
preventing the federal court from ever considering it. 
The state-litigation requirement relegates the Takings
Clause “to the status of a poor relation” among the provi-
sions of the Bill of Rights. Dolan v. City of Tigard , 512 
U. S. 374, 392 (1994).  Plaintiffs asserting any other con-
stitutional claim are guarant eed a federal forum under 
§1983, but the state-litigation requirement “hand[s] au -
thority over federal takings claims to state courts.”  San 
Remo, 545 U. S., at 350 (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in 
judgment).  Fidelity to the Takings Clause and our cases 
construing it requires overruling Williamson County and 
restoring takings claims to the full-fledged constitutional 
status the Framers envisioned when they included the 
Clause among the other protections in the Bill of Rights. 
III 
A 
 Contrary to Williamson County, a property owner has a
claim for a violation of the Takings Clause as soon as a 
government takes his property for public use without 
paying for it. The Clause provides: “[N]or shall private
property be taken for public use, without just compensa-
tion.” It does not say: “Nor shall private property be taken
for public use, without an available procedure that will
result in compensation.” If a local government takes 
private property without paying for it, that government
has violated the Fifth Amendment—just as the Takings
Clause says—without regard to subsequent state court 
proceedings. And the property owner may sue the gov-

Opinion of the Court 
ernment at that time in federal court for the “deprivation”
of a right “secured by the Constitution.”  42 U. S. C. §1983.
We have long recognized that property owners may 
bring Fifth Amendment claims against the Federal Gov-
ernment as soon as their property has been taken.  The 
Tucker Act, which provides  the standard procedure for 
bringing such claims, gives the Court of Federal Claims
jurisdiction to “render judgment upon any claim against 
the United States founded either upon the Constitution”
or any federal law or contract for damages “in cases not
sounding in tort.” 28 U. S. C. §1491(a)(1).  We have held 
that “[i]f there is a taking, the claim is ‘founded upon the
Constitution’ and within the jurisdiction of the Court of 
Claims to hear and determine.” United States v. Causby , 
328 U. S. 256, 267 (1946).  And we have explained that
“the act of taking” is the “event which gives rise to the 
claim for compensation.” United States v. Dow, 357 U. S. 
17, 22 (1958).
The Fifth Amendment right to full compensation arises 
at the time of the taking, regardless of post-taking reme -
dies that may be available to the property owner. That 
principle was confirmed in Jacobs v. United States, 290 
U. S. 13 (1933), where we held that a property owner 
found to have a valid takings claim is entitled to compen-
sation as if it had been “paid contemporaneously with the 
taking”—that is, the compensation must generally consist
of the total value of the property when taken, plus interest
from that time.  Id. , at 17 (quoting Seaboard Air Line R. 
Co. v. United States , 261 U. S. 299, 306 (1923)).  We re-
jected the view of the lower court that a property owner is 
entitled to interest only wh en the government provides a 
particular remedy—direct condemnation proceedings—
and not when the owner brings a takings suit under the 
Tucker Act.  “The form of the remedy d[oes] not qualify the 
right. It rest[s] upon the Fifth Amendment.” 290 U. S., 
at 16. 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
8 KNICK v. TOWNSHIP OF SCOTT 
Opinion of the Court 
Jacobs made clear that, no matter what sort of proce-
dures the government puts in place to remedy a taking, a
property owner has a Fifth Amendment entitlement to 
compensation as soon as the government takes his prop- 
erty without paying for it.  Whether the government does
nothing, forcing the owner to bring a takings suit under 
the Tucker Act, or whether it provides the owner with a 
statutory compensation remedy by initiating direct con-
demnation proceedings, the owner’s claim for compensa-
tion “rest[s] upon the Fifth Amendment.”
Although Jacobs concerned a taking by the Federal 
Government, the same reasoning applies to takings by the 
States. The availability of any particular compensation 
remedy, such as an inverse condemnation claim under 
state law, cannot infringe or restrict the property owner’s
federal constitutional claim—just as the existence of a 
state action for battery does not bar a Fourth Amendment 
claim of excessive force. The fact that the State has pro-
vided a property owner with a procedure that may subse-
quently result in just compensation cannot deprive the 
owner of his Fifth Amendment right to compensation
under the Constitution, leaving only the state law right.
And that is key because it is the existence of the Fifth 
Amendment right that allows the owner to proceed directly
to federal court under §1983. 
Williamson County had a different view of how the 
Takings Clause works.  According to Williamson County, a 
taking does not give rise to a federal constitutional right to 
just compensation at that time, but instead gives a right to 
a state law procedure that will eventually result in just 
compensation. As the Court put it, “if a State provides an 
adequate procedure for seeking just compensation, the
property owner cannot claim a violation of the [Takings] 
Clause until it has used the procedure and been denied 
just compensation.” 473 U. S., at 195.  In the absence of a 
state remedy, the Fifth Amendment right to compensation 

  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
9 Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2019) 
Opinion of the Court 
would attach immediately.  But, under Williamson County, 
the presence of a state remedy qualifies the right,
preventing it from vesting until exhaustion of the state 
procedure. That is what Jacobs confirmed could not be 
done. 
Just two years after Williamson County , in First Eng -
lish Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale  v. County of 
Los Angeles , 482 U. S. 304 (1987), the Court returned to
the understanding that the Fifth Amendment right to 
compensation automatically arises at the time the gov-
ernment takes property without paying for it.  Relying 
heavily on Jacobs and other Fifth Amendment precedents
neglected by Williamson County, First English held that a 
property owner is entitled to compensation for the tempo-
rary loss of his property. We  explained that “government 
action that works a taking of  property rights necessarily
implicates the ‘constitutional obligation to pay just com-
pensation.’”  482 U. S., at 315. Because of “the self-
executing character” of the Takings Clause “with respect 
to compensation,” a property owner has a constitutional
claim for just compensation at the time of the taking. 
Ibid. (quoting 6 P. Nichols, Eminent Domain §25.41 (3d 
rev. ed. 1972)).  The government’s post-taking actions 
(there, repeal of the challenged ordinance) cannot nullify 
the property owner’s existing Fifth Amendment right:
“[W]here the government’s activities have already worked
a taking of all use of property, no subsequent action by the 
government can relieve it of the duty to provide compensa-
tion.” 482 U. S., at 321.

3 First English distinguished Williamson County in a footnote, ex-
plaining that the case addressed only  “whether the constitutional claim 
was ripe for review” before the State denied compensation.  482 U. S., 
at 320, n. 10.  But Williamson County was based on the premise that 
there was no Fifth Amendment claim at all until the State denies 
compensation. Having rejected that premise, First English eliminated 
the rationale for the state-litigati on requirement.  The author of First 

  
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10 KNICK v. TOWNSHIP OF SCOTT 
Opinion of the Court 
In holding that a property owner acquires an irrevocable
right to just compensation immediately upon a taking, 
First English  adopted a position Justice Brennan had 
taken in an earlier dissent.  See id., at 315, 318 (quoting 
and citing San Diego Gas & Elec. Co.  v. San Diego , 450 
U. S. 621, 654, 657 (1981) (Brennan, J., dissenting)). 4  In 
that opinion, Justice Brennan explained that “once there
is a ‘taking,’ compensation must be awarded” because “[a]s 
soon as private property has been taken, whether through 
formal condemnation proceedings, occupancy, physical 
invasion, or regulation, the landowner has already suf-
fered a constitutional violation.” Id., at 654. 
First English embraced that view, reaffirming that “in
the event of a taking, the compensation remedy is required
by the Constitution.”  482 U. S., at 316; see ibid., n. 9 
(rejecting the view that “the Constitution does not, of its 
own force, furnish a basis for a court to award money
damages against the government” (quoting Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 14)). Compensation under the
Takings Clause is a remedy for the “constitutional viola-
tion” that “the landowner has already suffered” at the time 
of the uncompensated taking. San Diego Gas & Elec. Co. ,

English later recognized that it was “not clear . . . that Williamson 
County was correct in demanding that . . . the claimant must seek 
compensation in state court before bringing a federal takings claim in 
federal court.” San Remo Hotel, L. P. v. City and County of San Fran -
cisco, 545 U. S. 323, 349 (2005) (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in

4 Justice Brennan was joined by Ju stices Stewart, Marshall, and
Powell. The majority did not disagr ee with Justice Brennan’s analysis
of the merits, but concluded that the Court lacked jurisdiction to 
address the question pres ented.  Justice Rehnquist, concurring on the 
jurisdictional issue, noted that if he were satisfied that jurisdiction was 
proper, he “would have little difficulty in agreeing with much of what is
said in the dissenting opinion.”  450 U. S., at 633–634.  The Court 
reached the merits of th e question presented in San Diego in First 
English, adopting Justice Brennan’s view in an opinion by Chief Justice 
Rehnquist.

Opinion of the Court 
450 U. S., at 654 (Brennan, J., dissenting); see First Eng-
lish, 482 U. S., at 315. 
A later payment of compensation may remedy the con-
stitutional violation that occurred at the time of the tak-
ing, but that does not mean the violation never took place. 
The violation is the only reason compensation was owed in 
the first place.  A bank robber might give the loot back, 
but he still robbed the bank.  The availability of a subse-
quent compensation remedy for a taking without compen-
sation no more means there never was a constitutional 
violation in the first place than the availability of a dam-
ages action renders negligent conduct compliant with the 
duty of care. 
In sum, because a taking without compensation violates
the self-executing Fifth Amendment at the time of the 
taking, the property owner can bring a federal suit at that
time. Just as someone whose property has been taken by 
the Federal Government has a claim “founded . . . upon
the Constitution” that he may bring under the Tucker Act, 
someone whose property has been taken by a local gov-
ernment has a claim under §1983 for a “deprivation of [a] 
right[] . . . secured by the Constitution” that he may bring
upon the taking in federal court. The “general rule” is
that plaintiffs may bring co nstitutional claims under 
§1983 “without first bringing any sort of state lawsuit,
even when state court actions addressing the underlying
behavior are available.”  D. Dana & T. Merrill, Property: 
Takings 262 (2002); see McNeese v. Board of Ed. for Com-
munity Unit School Dist. 187 , 373 U. S. 668, 672 (1963) 
(observing that it would defeat the purpose of §1983 “if we
held that assertion of a federal claim in a federal court 
must await an attempt to vindicate the same claim in a 
state court”); Monroe  v. Pape , 365 U. S. 167, 183 (1961)

edy, and the latter need not be first sought and refused 
before the federal one is invoked.”).  This is as true for 

  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12 KNICK v. TOWNSHIP OF SCOTT 
Opinion of the Court 
takings claims as for any other claim grounded in the Bill
of Rights. 
B 
Williamson County effectively established an exhaustion
requirement for §1983 takings claims when it held that a 
property owner must pursue state procedures for obtain-
ing compensation before bringing a federal suit.  But the 
Court did not phrase its holding in those terms; if it had, 
its error would have been clear. Instead, Williamson 
County broke with the Court’s longstanding position that a 
property owner has a constitutional claim to compensation 
at the time the government de prives him of his property, 
and held that there can be no uncompensated taking, and 
thus no Fifth Amendment claim actionable under §1983,
until the property owner has tried and failed to obtain
compensation through the available state procedure.
“[U]ntil it has used the procedure and been denied just 
compensation,” the property owner “ ‘has no claim against 
the Government’ for a taking.”  473 U. S., at 194–195 
(quoting Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co. , 467 U. S. 986, 
1018, n. 21 (1984)). 
Williamson County drew that understanding of the
Clause from Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., a decision from 
the prior Term. Monsanto did not involve a takings claim 
for just compensation.  The plaintiff there sought to enjoin
a federal statute because it effected a taking, even though
the statute set up a special arbitration procedure for 
obtaining compensation, and the plaintiff could bring a 
takings claim pursuant to the Tucker Act if arbitration did 
not yield sufficient compensation.  467 U. S., at 1018.  The 
Court rejected the plaintiff ’s claim because “[e]quitable
relief is not available to enjoin an alleged taking of private 
property for a public use, duly authorized by law, when a
suit for compensation can be brought against the sover-
eign subsequent to the taking.” Id., at 1016 (footnote

Opinion of the Court 
omitted). That much is consistent with our precedent:
Equitable relief was not available because monetary relief
was under the Tucker Act. 
That was enough to decide the case. But Monsanto 
went on to say that if the plaintiff obtained compensation
in arbitration, then “no taking has occurred and the 
[plaintiff] has no claim against the Government.”  Id., at 
1018, n. 21.  Certainly it is correct that a fully compen-
sated plaintiff has no further claim, but that is because 
the taking has been remedied by compensation, not be-
cause there was no taking in the first place. See First 
English, 482 U. S., at 316, n. 9.  The statute in Monsanto 
simply required the plaintiff to attempt to vindicate its 
claim to compensation throug h arbitration before proceed-
ing under the Tucker Act. The case offers no support to 
Williamson County in this regard, because Congress—
unlike the States—is free to require plaintiffs to exhaust
administrative remedies befo re bringing constitutional 
claims. See McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U. S. 140, 144 
(1992) (“Where Congress specifically mandates, exhaus -
tion is required.”). 
Williamson County also relied on Monsanto when it 
analogized its new state-litigat ion requirement to federal
takings practice, stating that “taking[s] claims against the
Federal Government are premature until the property
owner has availed itself of the process provided by the
Tucker Act.”  473 U. S., at 195.  But the Court was simply 
confused. A claim for just compensation brought under
the Tucker Act is not a prerequisite to a Fifth Amendment 
takings claim—it is a Fifth Amendment takings claim.  A 
party who loses a Tucker Act suit has nowhere else to go 
to seek compensation for an alleged taking.
 Other than Monsanto, the principal case to which Wil-
liamson County looked was Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U. S. 
527 (1981). Like Monsanto, Parratt did not involve a 
takings claim for just compensation. Indeed, it was not a 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
14 KNICK v. TOWNSHIP OF SCOTT 
Opinion of the Court 
takings case at all.  Parratt held that a prisoner deprived
of $23.50 worth of hobby materials by the rogue act of a 
state employee could not state a due process claim if the 
State provided adequate post-d eprivation process.  451 
U. S., at 543–544.  But the analogy from the due process 
context to the takings context is strained, as Williamson 
County itself recognized. See 473 U. S., at 195, n. 14.  It is 
not even possible for a State to provide pre-deprivation 
due process for the unauthorized act of a single employee. 
That is quite different from the taking of property by the 
government through physical invasion or a regulation that
destroys a property’s productive use. 
The poor reasoning of Williamson County may be par-
tially explained by the circumstances in which the state-
litigation issue reached the Court. The Court granted 
certiorari to decide whether the Fifth Amendment entitles 
a property owner to just compensation when a regulation 
temporarily deprives him of the use of his property.  ( First 
English later held that the answer was yes.) As amicus 
curiae in support of the local government, the United
States argued in this Court that the developer could not
state a Fifth Amendment claim because it had not pursued
an inverse condemnation suit in state court. Neither 
party had raised that argument before.
5  The Court then 
adopted the reasoning of the Solicitor General in an alter-
native holding, even though the case could have been
resolved solely on the narrower and settled ground that no

5 The Solicitor General continues this  tradition here, arguing for the
first time as amicus curiae  that state inverse condemnation claims 
“aris[e] under” federal law and can be brought in federal court under 28
U. S. C. §1331 through the Grable doctrine. Brief for United States as 
Amicus Curiae 22–24; see Grable & Sons Metal Products,  Inc. v. Darue 
Engineering & Mfg. , 545 U. S. 308 (2005).  Because we agree with the 
Solicitor General’s principal contention that federal takings claims can 
be brought immediately under §1983, we have no occasion to consider 
his novel §1331 argument.

taking had occurred because the zoning board had not yet 
come to a final decision regarding the developer’s proposal. 
In these circumstances, the Court may not have ade -
quately tested the logic of the state-litigation requirement
or considered its implications, most notably the preclusion 
trap later sprung by San Remo. That consequence was
totally unanticipated in Williamson County. 
The dissent, doing what respondents do not even dare to
attempt, defends the original rationale of Williamson 
County—that there is no Fifth Amendment violation, and 
thus no Fifth Amendment claim, until the government 
denies the property owner compensation in a subsequent 
proceeding.
6  But although the dissent makes a more 
thoughtful and considered argument than Williamson 
County, it cannot reconcile its view with our repeated
holdings that a property owner acquires a constitutional 
right to compensation at the time of the taking. See su-
pra, at 7–11.  The only reason that a taking would auto-
matically entitle a property owner to the remedy of com-
pensation is that, as Justice Brennan explained, with the
uncompensated taking “the landowner has already suf-

6 The dissent thinks that respondents still press this theory. Post, at 
6 n. 3.  But respondents instead describe Williamson County as resting 
on an understanding not of the elem ents of a federal takings claim but
of the scope of 42 U. S. C. §1983.  They even go so far as to rewrite 
petitioner’s question presented in such terms.  Brief for Respondents i.
For respondents, it does not matt er whether a property owner has a 
Fifth Amendment claim at the time of a taking.  What matters is that, 
in respondents’ view, no constitutional violation occurs  for purposes of 
§1983 until the government has subs equently denied compensation. 
That characterization has no basis in the Williamson County opinion,
which did not even quote §1983 and stated that the Court’s reasoning
applied with equal force to takings by the Federal Government, not 
covered by §1983.  473 U. S., at 195.  Respondents’ attempt to recast 
the state-litigation requirement as a §1983-specific rule fails for the 
same reason as the logic of Williamson County—a property owner has a 
Fifth Amendment claim for a violation of the Takings Clause as soon as
the government takes his property without paying for it.

fered a constitutional violation.”  San Diego Gas & Elec. 
Co., 450 U. S., at 654 (dissenting opinion).  The dissent 
here provides no more reason  to resist that conclusion 
than did Williamson County. 
C 
The Court in Williamson County relied on statements in 
our prior opinions that the Clause “does not provide or 
require that compensation shall be actually paid in ad -
vance of the occupancy of the land to be taken.  But the 
owner is entitled to reasonable, certain and adequate
provision for obtaining compensation” after a taking. 
Cherokee Nation v. Southern Kansas R. Co. , 135 U. S. 641, 
659 (1890). Respondents rely on the same cases in con-
tending that uncompensated takings for which compensa-
tion is subsequently available do not violate the Fifth
Amendment at the time of the taking.  But respondents
read those statements too broadly.  They concerned re-
quests for injunctive relief, and the availability of subse-
quent compensation meant that such an equitable remedy
was not available.  See Regional Rail Reorganization Act 
Cases, 419 U. S. 102, 107, 149 (1974) (reversing a decision
“enjoin[ing]” the enforcement of a federal statute because 
“the availability of the Tucker Act guarantees an adequate
remedy at law for any taking which might occur”); Hurley 
v. Kincaid, 285 U. S. 95, 99, 105 (1932) (rejecting a request 
to “enjoin the carrying out of any work” on a flood control 
project because the Tucker Act provided the plaintiff with 
“a plain, adequate, and complete remedy at law”).  Simply 
because the property owner was not entitled to injunctive
relief at the time of the taking does not mean there was no
violation of the Takings Clause at that time. 
The history of takings litig ation provides valuable con-
text. At the time of the founding there usually was no 
compensation remedy available to property owners. On 
occasion, when a legislature authorized a particular gov -

Opinion of the Court 
ernment action that took private property, it might also
create a special owner-initiated procedure for obtaining
compensation. But there were no general causes of action 
through which plaintiffs could obtain compensation for
property taken for public use.  Brauneis, The First Consti-
tutional Tort: The Remedial Revolution in Nineteenth-
Century State Just Compensation Law, 52 Vand. L. Rev.
57, 69–70, and n. 33 (1999). 
Until the 1870s, the typical recourse of a property owner 
who had suffered an uncompensated taking was to bring a
common law trespass action against the responsible corpo-
ration or government official. The official would then raise 
the defense that his trespass was lawful because author-
ized by statute or ordinance, and the plaintiff would 
respond that the law was unconstitutional because it 
provided for a taking without just compensation. If the 
plaintiff prevailed, he nonetheless had no way at common
law to obtain money damage s for a permanent taking—
that is, just compensation for the total value of his prop- 
erty.  He could obtain only retrospective damages, as well as 
an injunction ejecting the government from his property
going forward.  See id., at 67–69, 97–99. 
As Chancellor Kent explained when granting a property 
owner equitable relief, the Takings Clause and its analogs
in state constitutions required that “a fair compensation
must, in all cases, be previously made to the individuals 
affected.” Gardner v. Newburgh, 2 Johns. Ch. 162, 166 
(N. Y. 1816) (emphasis added). If a government took 
property without payment, a court would set aside the 
taking because it violated the Constitution and order the 
property restored to its owner. The Framers meant to 
prohibit the Federal Government from taking property
without paying for it.  A llowing the government to keep
the property pending subsequent compensation to the
owner, in proceedings that hardly existed in 1787, was not 
what they envisioned. 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
18 KNICK v. TOWNSHIP OF SCOTT 
Opinion of the Court 
Antebellum courts, which had no means of compensat-
ing a property owner for his loss, had no way to redress
the violation of an owner’s Fifth Amendment rights other 
than ordering the government to give him back his prop- 
erty. See Callender v. Marsh, 18 Mass. 418, 430–431 (1823)
(“[I]f by virtue of any legislative act the land of any citizen
should be occupied by the public . . . , without any means
provided to indemnify the owner of the property, . . . be -
cause such a statute would be directly contrary to the
[Massachusetts takings clause]; and as no action can be
maintained against the public for damages, the only way 
to secure the party in his cons titutional rights would be to
declare void the public appropriation.”).  But in the 1870s, 
as state courts began to recognize implied rights of action
for damages under the state equivalents of the Takings
Clause, they declined to grant injunctions because prop- 
erty owners had an adequate remedy at law.  See, e.g., Stet-
son v. Chicago & Evanston R. Co. , 75 Ill. 74, 78 (1874) 
(“What injury, if any, [the pr operty owner] has sustained, 
may be compensated by damage s recoverable by an action
at law.”); see also Brauneis, supra, at 97–99, 110–112.  On 
the federal level, Congress enabled property owners to 
obtain compensation for takings in federal court when it 
passed the Tucker Act in 1887, and we subsequently 
joined the state courts in holding that the compensation
remedy is required by the Takings Clause itself.  See First 
English, 482 U. S., at 316 (collecting cases). 
Today, because the federal and nearly all state govern-
ments provide just compensation remedies to property
owners who have suffered a taking, equitable relief is 
generally unavailable.  As long as an adequate provision
for obtaining just compensation exists, there is no basis to
enjoin the government’s action effecting a taking.  But 
that is because, as the Court explained in First English , 
such a procedure is a remedy for a taking that violated the 
Constitution, not because the availability of the procedure

Opinion of the Court 
somehow prevented the violation from occurring in the 
first place. See supra, at 9–11.7 
The dissent contends that our characterization of Cher-
okee Nation effectively overrules “a hundred-plus years of 
legal rulings.”  Post, at 6 (opinion of K AGAN, J.). But 
under today’s decision every one of the cases cited by the
dissent would come out the same way—the plaintiffs
would not be entitled to the relief they requested because
they could instead pursue a suit for compensation.  The 
premise of such a suit for compensation is that the prop- 
erty owner has already suffered a violation of the Fifth 
Amendment that may be remedied by money damages.

We conclude that a government violates the Takings
Clause when it takes property without compensation, and 
—————— 
7 Among the cases invoking the Cherokee Nation language that the 
parties have raised, only one, Yearsley v. W. A. Ross Constr. Co. , 309 
U. S. 18 (1940), rejected a demand for compensation.  Yearsley con-
cerned a state tort suit alleging a taking by a contractor building dikes 
for the Federal Government.  In ruling for the contractors, we sug- 
gested that the taking did not violate the Fifth Amendment because the 
property owner had the opportunity to pursue a claim for just compen-
sation under the Tucker Act.  As explained, however, a claim for com -
pensation brought under the Tucker Act is a claim for a violation of the 
Fifth Amendment; it does not prev ent a violation from occurring.
Regardless, Yearsley was right to hold that the contractors were im-
mune from suit. Because the Tucker  Act provides a complete remedy 
for any taking by the Federal Govern ment, it “excludes liability of the 
Government’s representatives lawfully acting on its behalf in relation
to the taking,” barring the plaintif fs from seeking any relief from the 
contractors themselves. Id., at 22. 
8 The dissent also asserts that today’s ruling “betrays judicial federal-
ism.” Post, at 15.  But since the Civil Rights Act of 1871, part of “judi -
cial federalism” has been the availabi lity of a federal cause of action 
when a local government violates the Constitution.  42 U. S. C. §1983. 
Invoking that federal protection in the face of state action violating
the Fifth Amendment cannot properly be regarded as a betrayal of 
federalism. 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
20 KNICK v. TOWNSHIP OF SCOTT 
Opinion of the Court 
that a property owner may bring a Fifth Amendment 
claim under §1983 at that time. That does not as a practi-
cal matter mean that governme nt action or regulation
may not proceed in the absence of contemporaneous com -
pensation. Given the availability of post-taking compen-
sation, barring the government from acting will ordinarily 
not be appropriate. But because the violation is complete
at the time of the taking, pursuit of a remedy in federal
court need not await any subsequent state action.  Tak-
ings claims against local governments should be handled
the same as other claims under the Bill of Rights.  Wil-
liamson County erred in holding otherwise. 
IV 
The next question is whether we should overrule Wil-
liamson County, or whether stare decisis counsels in favor 
of adhering to the decision, despite its error.  The doctrine 
of stare decisis reflects a judgment “that ‘in most matters
it is more important that the applicable rule of law be
settled than that it be settled right.’ ”  Agostini v. Felton , 
521 U. S. 203, 235 (1997) (quoting Burnet v. Coronado Oil 
& Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 406 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissent-
ing)). The doctrine “is at its weakest when we interpret 
the Constitution,” as we did in Williamson County , be-
cause only this Court or a constitutional amendment can 
alter our holdings. Agostini, 521 U. S., at 235. 
We have identified several factors to consider in decid-
ing whether to overrule a pa st decision, including “the 
quality of [its] reasoning, the workability of the rule it 
established, its consistency wi th other related decisions, 
. . . and reliance on the decision.” Janus v. State, County, 
and Municipal Employees, 585 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2018) 
(slip op., at 34–35).  All of these factors counsel in favor of 
overruling Williamson County. 
Williamson County was not just wrong. Its reasoning
was exceptionally ill founded and conflicted with much of

Opinion of the Court 
our takings jurisprudence.  See supra, at 12–14.  Its key 
conclusion, which it drew from unnecessary language in 
Monsanto—that a property owner does not have a ripe
federal takings claim until he has unsuccessfully pursued 
an initial state law claim for just compensation—ignored 
Jacobs and many subsequent decisions holding that a 
property owner acquires a Fifth Amendment right to
compensation at the time of a taking.  This contradiction 
was on stark display just two years later in First English. 
The decision has come in fo r repeated criticism over the
years from Justices of this Court and many respected 
commentators. See San Remo , 545 U. S., at 348 
(Rehnquist, C. J., joined by O’Connor, Kennedy, and 
T
HOMAS, JJ., concurring in judgment); Arrigoni Enter-
prises, LLC v. Durham, 578 U. S. ___ (2016) (T HOMAS, J.,

State Law Remedies, and the Fourteenth Amendment, 86 
Colum. L. Rev. 979, 989 (1986).  Even the academic de-
fenders of the state-litigation requirement base it on 
federalism concerns (although they do not reconcile those
concerns with the settled construction of §1983) rather 
than the reasoning of the opinion itself.  See Echeverria,

requirement has been a rule in search of a justification for

Opinion of the Court 
over 30 years. We eventually  abandoned the view that the
requirement is an element of a takings claim and recast it
as a “prudential” ripeness rule. See Horne  v. Department 
of Agriculture , 569 U. S. 513, 525–526 (2013); Suitum v. 
Tahoe Regional Planning Agency , 520 U. S. 725, 733–734 
(1997). No party defends that approach here. See Brief 
for Respondents 37; Brief for United States as Amicus 
Curiae 19–20.  Respondents have taken a new tack, adopt-
ing a §1983–specific theory at which Williamson County
did not even hint.  See n. 6, supra.  The fact that the justi-
fication for the state-litigati on requirement continues to
evolve is another factor undermining the force of stare 
decisis. See Janus, 585 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 23). 
The state-litigation requirement has also proved to be
unworkable in practice. Williamson County envisioned 
that takings plaintiffs would ripen their federal claims in
state court and then, if necessary, bring a federal suit 
under §1983. But, as we held in San Remo , the state 
court’s resolution of the plaintiff ’s inverse condemnation 
claim has preclusive effect in any subsequent federal suit.
The upshot is that many takings plaintiffs never have the 
opportunity to litigate in a federal forum that §1983 by its 
terms seems to provide.  That significant consequence was
not considered by the Court in Williamson County. 
The dissent argues that our constitutional holding in
Williamson County  should enjoy the “enhanced” form of 
stare decisis  we usually reserve for statutory decisions, 
because Congress could have eliminated the San Remo 
preclusion trap by amending the full faith and credit 
statute. Post, at 17 (quoting Kimble v. Marvel Entertain-
ment, LLC, 578 U. S. ___, ___ (slip op., at 8)).  But takings
plaintiffs, unlike plaintiffs bringing any other constitu-
tional claim, would still have been forced to pursue relief 
under state law before they could bring suit in federal 
court. Congress could not have lifted that unjustified
exhaustion requirement because, under Williamson County,

Opinion of the Court 
a property owner had no federal claim until a state
court denied him compensation.
Finally, there are no reliance interests on the state-
litigation requirement. We have recognized that the force 
of stare decisis is “reduced” when rules that do not “serve 
as a guide to lawful behavior” are at issue. United States 
v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 521 (1995); see Alleyne v. United 
States, 570 U. S. 99, 119 (2013) (S OTOMAYOR, J., concur -
ring). Our holding that uncompensated takings violate
the Fifth Amendment will not expose governments to new
liability; it will simply allow into federal court takings
claims that otherwise would have been brought as inverse
condemnation suits in state court. 
Governments need not fear that our holding will lead
federal courts to invalidate their regulations as unconsti-
tutional. As long as just compensation remedies are 
available—as they have been for nearly 150 years—
injunctive relief will be foreclosed.  For the same reason, 
the Federal Government need not worry that courts will 
set aside agency actions as unconstitutional under the 
Administrative Procedure Act.  5 U. S. C. §706(2)(B). 
Federal courts will not invalidate an otherwise lawful 
uncompensated taking when the property owner can
receive complete relief through a Fifth Amendment claim 
brought under the Tucker Act.
In light of all the foregoing, the dissent cannot, with
respect, fairly maintain its extreme assertions regarding
our application of the principle of stare decisis. 
* * * 
The state-litigation requirement of Williamson County 
is overruled. A property owner may bring a takings claim 
under §1983 upon the taking of his property without just
compensation by a local government. The judgment of the
United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is
vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings 
consistent with this opinion. 
It is so ordered.

No. 17–647 
ROSE MARY KNICK, PETITIONER v. TOWNSHIP OF 
SCOTT, PENNSYLVANIA, ET AL. 
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 
APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
[June 21, 2019]
 JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring. 
The Fifth Amendment’s Takings Clause prohibits the 
government from “tak[ing]” private property “without just
compensation.” The Court correct ly interprets this text by
holding that a violation of this Clause occurs as soon as
the government takes property without paying for it. 
The United States, by contrast, urges us not to enforce
the Takings Clause as written. It worries that requiring 
payment to accompany a taki ng would allow courts to 
enjoin or invalidate broad re gulatory programs “merely”
because the program takes property without paying for it.
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 12. According to 
the United States, “there is a ‘nearly infinite variety of 
ways in which government actions or regulations can 
affect property interests,’” and it ought to be good enough
that the government “implicitly promises to pay compen-
sation for any taking” if a property owner successfully
sues the government in court.  Supplemental Letter Brief
for United States as Amicus Curiae 5 (Supp. Brief) (citing 
the Tucker Act, 28 U. S. C. §1491).  Government officials, 
the United States contends, should be able to implement 
regulatory programs “without fear” of injunction or invali-
dation under the Takings Clause, “even when” the pro-
gram is so far reaching t hat the officials “cannot deter-
mine whether a taking will occur.” Supp. Brief 5. 

  
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
 
2 KNICK v. TOWNSHIP OF SCOTT 
THOMAS, J., concurring 
This “sue me” approach to the Takings Clause is unten-
able. The Fifth Amendment does not merely provide a
damages remedy to a property owner willing to “shoulder 
the burden of securing compensation” after the govern-
ment takes property without paying for it.  Arrigoni En -
terprises, LLC  v. Durham, 578 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) 
(T
HOMAS, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (slip op., 
at 2).  Instead, it makes just compensation a “prerequisite” 
to the government’s authority to “tak[e] property for public
use.” Ibid.  A “purported exercise of the eminent-domain
power” is therefore “invalid” unless the government “pays 
just compensation before or at the time of its taking.” Id., 
at ___ (slip op., at 3).  If this requirement makes some 
regulatory programs “unworkable in practice,” Supp. Brief 
5, so be it—our role is to enforce the Takings Clause as 
written. 
Of course, as the Court correctly explains, the United 
States’ concerns about injunctions may be misplaced. 
Ante, at 15–18.  Injunctive relief is not available when an
adequate remedy exists at law. E.g., Monsanto Co. v. 
Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U. S. 139, 156 (2010).  And even 
when relief is appropriate for a particular plaintiff, it does 
not follow that a court may enjoin or invalidate an entire
regulatory “program,” Supp. Brief 5, by granting relief 
“beyond the parties to the case,” Trump v. Hawaii, 585 
U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (T
HOMAS, J., concurring) (slip op., at 
6); see id., at ___ (slip op., at 2) (expressing skepticism 
about “universal injunctions”).
Still, “[w]hen the government repudiates [its] duty” to 
pay just compensation, its actions “are not only unconsti-
tutional” but may be “tortious as well.” Monterey v. Del 
Monte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd. , 526 U. S. 687, 717 (1999) 
(plurality opinion). I do not understand the Court’s opin-
ion to foreclose the application of ordinary remedial prin-
ciples to takings claims and related common-law tort
claims, such as trespass. I therefore join it in full.

No. 17–647 
ROSE MARY KNICK, PETITIONER v. TOWNSHIP OF 
SCOTT, PENNSYLVANIA, ET AL. 
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 
APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
[June 21, 2019] 
JUSTICE KAGAN, with whom J USTICE GINSBURG, 
JUSTICE BREYER, and J USTICE SOTOMAYOR join,
dissenting. 
Today, the Court formally overrules Williamson County 
Regional Planning Comm’n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson 
City, 473 U. S. 172 (1985).  But its decision rejects far
more than that single case. Williamson County was rooted 
in an understanding of the Fifth Amendment’s Takings 
Clause stretching back to the late 1800s.  On that view, a 
government could take property so long as it provided a
reliable mechanism to pay just compensation, even if the 
payment came after the fact.  No longer. The majority 
today holds, in conflict with precedent after precedent, 
that a government violates the Constitution whenever it 
takes property without advance compensation—no matter
how good its commitment to pay. That conclusion has no 
basis in the Takings Clause.  Its consequence is to channel
a mass of quintessentially local cases involving complex 
state-law issues into federal courts. And it transgresses
all usual principles of stare decisis.  I respectfully dissent. 
I 
Begin with the basics—the meaning of the Takings 
Clause. The right that Clause confers is not to be free 
from government takings of property for public purposes. 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2 KNICK v. TOWNSHIP OF SCOTT 
KAGAN, J., dissenting 
Instead, the right is to be free from those takings when the
government fails to provide “just compensation.”  In other 
words, the government can take private property for pub-
lic purposes, so long as it fair ly pays the property owner. 
That precept, which the majority does not contest, comes
straight out of the constitutional text: “[P]rivate property
[shall not] be taken for public use, without just compensa-
tion.” Amdt. 5. “As its language indicates, [the Takings
Clause] does not prohibit the taking of private property, 
but instead places a condition on the exercise of that
power.” First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of 
Glendale v. County of Los Angeles , 482 U. S. 304, 314 
(1987). And that constitutional choice accords with an -
cient principles about what governments do.  The eminent 
domain power—the capacity to “take private property for 
public uses”—is an integral “attribute of sovereignty.” 
Boom Co. v. Patterson , 98 U. S. 403, 406 (1879); see Kohl 
v. United States , 91 U. S. 367, 371 (1876) (The power is
“essential to [the Government’s] independent existence 
and perpetuity”). Small surprise, then, that the Constitu-
tion does not prohibit takings for public purposes, but only
requires the government to pay fair value. 
In that way, the Takings Clause is unique among the
Bill of Rights’ guarantees. It is, for example, unlike the
Fourth Amendment’s protection against excessive force—
which the majority mistakenly proposes as an analogy. 
See ante, at 8. Suppose a law enforcement officer uses 
excessive force and the victim recovers damages for his 
injuries. Did a constitutional violation occur?  Of course. 
The Constitution prohibits what the officer did; the pay-
ment of damages merely remedied the constitutional 
wrong.  But the Takings Clause is different because it does
not prohibit takings; to the contrary, it permits them
provided the government gives just compensation. So 
when the government “takes and pays,” it is not violating
the Constitution at all. Put another way, a Takings

KAGAN, J., dissenting 
Clause violation has two necessary elements. First, the 
government must take the property.  Second, it must deny
the property owner just compensation. See Horne v. De-
partment of Agriculture , 569 U. S. 513, 525–526 (2013) 
(“[A] Fifth Amendment claim is premature until it is clear 
that the Government has both taken property and denied 
just compensation” (emphasis in original)).  If the govern-
ment has not done both, no constitutional violation has 
happened. All this is well-trod ground.  See, e.g., United 
States v. Jones, 109 U. S. 513, 518 (1883); Albert Hanson 
Lumber Co.  v. United States , 261 U. S. 581, 586 (1923). 
Even the majority (despite its faulty analogy) does not 
contest it. 
Similarly well-settled—until the majority’s opinion
today—was the answer to a follow-on question: At what 
point has the government denied a property owner just 
compensation, so as to complete a Fifth Amendment viola-
tion? For over a hundred years, this Court held that
advance or contemporaneous payment was not required,
so long as the government had established reliable proce-
dures for an owner to later obtain just compensation (in-
cluding interest for any time elapsed).  The rule got its
start in Cherokee Nation  v. Southern Kansas R. Co. , 135 
U. S. 641 (1890), where the Tribe argued that a federal
statute authorizing condemnation of its property violated 
the Fifth Amendment because the law did not require
advance payment. The Court disagreed.  It held that the 
Takings Clause “does not provide or require that compen-
sation shall be actually paid in advance of the occupancy
of the land to be taken” so long as the government made
available to the owner “reasonable, certain and adequate 
provision for obtaining compensation” afterward. Id., at 
659. Decade after decade, the Court repeated that princi-
ple.

does not demand “that compensation should be made

provided for a reasonably just and prompt ascertainment 
and payment of the compensation.”  Crozier  v. Krupp A. 
G., 224 U. S. 290, 306 (1912).  And the Court also made 
clear that a statute creating a right of action against the 
responsible government entity generally qualified as a 
constitutionally adequate comp ensatory mechanism.  See, 
e.g., Williams v. Parker , 188 U. S. 491, 502 (1903); Years-
ley v. W. A. Ross Constr. Co., 309 U. S. 18, 20–21 (1940).

Williamson County followed from those decisions as 
night the day. The case began when a local planning
commission rejected a prop erty owner’s development
proposal. The owner chose not to seek compensation
through the procedure the St ate had created—an “inverse 
condemnation” action against the commission. Instead, 
the owner sued in federal court alleging a Takings Clause 
violation under 42 U. S. C. §1983.  Consistent with the 
century’s worth of precedent I have recounted above, the
Court found that no Fifth Amendment violation had yet
occurred. See 473 U. S., at 195.  The Court first recog-
nized that “[t]he Fifth Amendment does not proscribe the

U. S. 557, 568 (1898); Sweet v. Rechel, 159 U. S. 380, 400–402 (1895). 
2 In many of these cases, the Court held as well that if payment oc -
curs later, it must include interest.  See, e.g., id., at 407; Albert Hanson 
Lumber Co., 261 U. S., at 586.  That requirement flows from the consti-
tutional demand for “just” compensa tion: As one of the early cases 
explained, the property owner must be placed “in as good position 
pecuniarily as he would have been if his property had not been taken.”

taking of property; it proscribes taking without just com -
pensation.” Id., at 194. Next, the Court stated (citing no
fewer than five precedents) that the Amendment does not
demand that “compensation be paid in advance of, or 
contemporaneously with, the taking.” Ibid.  “[A]ll that is
required,” the Court continued, is that the State have 
provided “a ‘reasonable, certain and adequate provision for 
obtaining compensation.’”  Ibid. (quoting Cherokee Nation, 
135 U. S., at 659).  Here, the State had done so: Nothing
suggested that the inverse condemnation procedure was
inadequate.  473 U. S., at 196–197.  So the property own-
er’s claim was “not yet ripe”: The owner could not “claim a
violation of the [Takings] Clause until it [had] used the
procedure and been denied.”  Id., at 194–195. 
So contrary to the majority’s portrayal, Williamson 
County did not result from some inexplicable confusion 
about “how the Takings Clause works.”  Ante, at 8. Far 
from it. Williamson County  built on a long line of deci -
sions addressing the elements of a Takings Clause viola-
tion. The Court there said only two things remotely new.
First, the Court found that the State’s inverse condemna-
tion procedure qualified as a “reasonable, certain and 
adequate” procedure.  But no one in this case disputes 
anything to do with that conclusion—including that the 
equivalent Pennsylvania procedure here is similarly ade-
quate. Second, the Court held that a §1983 suit could not 
be brought until a property owner had unsuccessfully 
invoked the State’s procedure for obtaining payment.  But 
that was a direct function of the Court’s prior holdings.
Everyone agrees that a §1983 suit cannot be brought
before a constitutional violation has occurred.  And accord-
ing to the Court’s repeated decisions, a Takings Clause
violation does not occur until an owner has used the gov-
ernment’s procedures and failed to obtain just compensa-
tion. All that Williamson County did was to put the period
on an already-completed sentence about when a takings

claim arises.3 
Today’s decision thus ov erthrows the Court’s long-
settled view of the Takings Clause.  The majority declares,
as against a mountain of precedent, that a government 
taking private property for public purposes must pay
compensation at that mome nt or in advance.  See ante, at 
6–7. If the government fails to do so, a constitutional
violation has occurred, regard less of whether “reasonable,
certain and adequate” compensatory mechanisms exist. 
Cherokee Nation, 135 U. S., at 659.  And regardless of how 
many times this Court has said the opposite before. Un-
der cover of overruling “only”  a single decision, today’s
opinion smashes a hundred-plus years of legal rulings to
smithereens. 
II 
So how does the majority defend taking down William-
son County and its many precursors?  Its decision rests on 
four ideas: a comparison between takings claims and other 
constitutional claims, a re sort to the Takings Clause’s 
—————— 
3 Contrary to the majority’s description, see ante, at 15, and n. 6, the 
respondents have exactly this view of Williamson County  ( a n d  o f  t h e 
cases preceding it).  The respondents discuss (as I do, see supra, at 3–4) 
the “long line of precedent” holding th at “the availability of a reason -
able, certain, and adequate inverse-condemnation procedure fulfills the
duty” of a government to pay just compensation for a taking.  Brief for 
Respondents 22–23.  The respondents then conclude (again, as I do, see 
supra, at 4–6) that Williamson County “sound[ly]” and “straightfor-
wardly applied that precedent to hold that a property owner who 
forgoes an available and adequate inverse-condemnation remedy has 
not been deprived of any constitutional right and thus cannot proceed 
under Section 1983.”  Brief for Respondents 22.  (Again contra the 
majority, the respondents’ only th eory of §1983 is the one everyone
agrees with—that a §1983 suit cannot be brought before a constitu -
tional violation has occurred.)  So while I appreciate the compliment, I 
cannot claim to argue anything novel or “dar[ing]” here.  Ante, at 15. 
My argument is the same as the respondents’, which is the same as 
Williamson County’s, which is the same as all the prior precedents’.

text, and theories about two lines of this Court’s prece -
dent. All are misguided. The majority uses the term 
“shaky foundations.”  Ante, at 21. It knows whereof it 
speaks.
The first crack comes from the repeated assertion (al-
ready encountered in the majority’s Fourth Amendment 
analogy, see supra, at 2) that Williamson County treats 
takings claims worse than other claims founded in the Bill 
of Rights. See ante, at 6, 8, 11–12, 20.  That is not so. The 
distinctive aspects of litigating a takings claim merely
reflect the distinctive aspects of the constitutional right.
Once again, a Fourth Amendment claim arises at the
moment a police officer uses excessive force, because the
Constitution prohibits that thing and that thing only.
(Similarly, for the majority’s other analogies, a bank rob -
ber commits his offense when he robs a bank and a tort-
feasor when he acts negligently—because that conduct,
a n d  i t  a l o n e ,  i s  w h a t  t h e  l a w  f o r b i d s . )   O r  t o  m a k e  t h e 
same point a bit differently, even if a government could 
compensate the victim in advance—as the majority re-
quires here—the victim would still suffer constitutional 
injury when the force is used.  But none of that is true of 
Takings Clause violations.  That kind of infringement, as
explained, is complete only after two things occur: (1) the 
government takes property, and (2) it fails to pay just
compensation. See supra, at 2–3. All Williamson County
and its precursors do is recognize that fact, by saying that 
a constitutional claim (and thus a §1983 suit) arises only 
after the second condition is met—when the property
owner comes away from the government’s compensatory
procedure empty-handed. That is to treat the Takings
Clause exactly as its dual elements require—and because 
that is so, neither worse nor better than any other right.
Second, the majority contends that its rule follows from
the constitutional text, bec ause the Takings Clause does
not say “[n]or shall private property be taken for public

use, without an available procedure that will result in 
compensation.” Ante, at 6. There is a reason the majority 
devotes only a few sentences to that argument.  Because 
here’s another thing the text does not say: “Nor shall
private property be taken for public use, without advance
or contemporaneous payment of just compensation, not-
withstanding ordinary procedures .”  In other words, the 
text no more states the majority’s rule than it does Wil-
liamson County ’s (and its precursors’). As constitutional 
text often is, the Takings Clause is spare. It says that a 
government taking property  must pay just compensa-
tion—but does not say through exactly what mechanism or 
at exactly what time. That was left to be worked out, 
consistent with the Clause’s (minimal) text and purpose.
And from 1890 until today, this Court worked it out Wil-
liamson County ’s way, rather than the majority’s. See 
supra, at 3–4.  Under our caselaw, a government could use
reliable post-taking compen satory mechanisms (with
payment calculated from the taking) without violating the 
Takings Clause.
Third, the majority tries to explain away that mass of 
precedent, with a theory so, we ll, inventive that it appears 
in neither the petitioner’s nor her 15-plus amici’s briefs.  
Don’t read the decisions “too broadly,” the majority says. 
Ante, at 16.  Yes, the Court in each rejected a takings
claim, instructing the property owner to avail herself 
instead of a government-created compensatory mecha-
nism. But all the Court meant (the majority says) was 
that the plaintiffs had sought the wrong kind of relief:
They could not get injunctions because the available com -
pensatory procedures gave an adequate remedy at law. 
The Court still believed (so says the majority) that the 
cases involved constitutional violations. Or said otherwise 
(again, according to the majority), the Court still under-
stood the Takings Clause to prohibit delayed payment. 
Points for creativity, but that is just not what the deci-

sions say. Most of the cases involved requests for injunc-
tions, but the equity/law distinction played little or no role 
in our analyses. Instead, the decisions addressed directly 
what the Takings Clause requires (or not).  And as already 
shown, supra, at 3–4, they held that the Clause does not 
demand advance payment.  Beginning again at the begin-
ning, Cherokee Nation decided that the Takings Clause
“does not provide or require that compensation shall be
actually paid in advance.”  135 U. S., at 659.  In Backus v. 
Fort Street Union Depot Co. , 169 U. S. 557, 567–568 
(1898), the Court declared that a property owner had no
“constitutional right to have the amount of his compensa-
tion finally determined and paid before yielding posses-
sion.” By the time of Williams v. Parker, 188 U. S., at 502, 
the Court could state that “it is settled by repeated deci-
sions” that the Constitution allows the taking of property 
“prior to any payment.”  Similarly, in Joslin Mfg. Co. v. 
Providence, 262 U. S. 668, 677 (1923), the Court noted that 
“[i]t has long been settled that the taking of property . . . 
need not be accompanied or preceded by payment, but that 
the requirement of just compensation is satisfied when”
there is a pledge of “reasonably prompt ascertainment and 
payment.” In Hurley v. Kincaid, 285 U. S. 95, 104 (1932),
the Court repeated that the “Fifth Amendment does not
entitle [a property owner] to be paid in advance of the 
taking.” I could go on—there  are eighty more years to
cover, and more decisions in the early years too—but by
now you probably get the idea.
Well, just one more especially good demonstration. In 
Yearsley v. W. A. Ross Constr. Co. , 309 U. S. 18 (1940), the 
plaintiffs sought money damages for an alleged Takings
Clause violation. For that reason, the Court’s theory 
about suits seeking injunctions has no possible applica-
tion. Still, the Court rejected the claim: The different 
remedy requested made no difference in the result. And 
yet more important: In refusing to find a Takings Clause

had in all the cases requesting injunctions. Once again,
the Court did not focus on the nature of the relief sought. 
It simply explained that th e government had provided a 
procedure for obtaining post-taking compensation—and 
that was enough.  “The Fifth Amendment does not entitle 
him [the owner] to be paid in advance of the taking,” held 
the Court, quoting the last injunction case described 
above. Id., at 21 (quoting Hurley, 285 U. S., at 104; brack-
ets in original). Because the government had set up an
adequate compensatory mechanism, the taking was “within
[the government’s] constitutional power.”  309 U. S., at 
22. Once again, the opposite of what the majority pro-
nounces today.

Fourth and finally, the majority lays claim to another
line of decisions—involving the Tucker Act—but with no 
greater success.  The Tucker Act waives the Federal Gov-
ernment’s sovereign immunity and grants the Court of 
Federal Claims jurisdiction over suits seeking compensa-
tion for takings.  See 28 U. S. C. §1491(a)(1).  According to

4 The majority’s supposed best case to the contrary, First English 
Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482 
U. S. 304 (1987), is not so good, as is apparent from its express state -
ment that it accords with Williamson County. See 482 U. S., at 320, 
n. 10. In First English, the Court held that a property owner was 
entitled to compensation for the te mporary loss of his property, occur-
ring while a (later-repealed) re gulation was in effect. See id., at 321. 
The Court made clear that a govern ment’s duty to compensate for a 
taking—including a temporary taki ng—arises from the Fifth Amend-
ment, as of course it does.  See id., at 315.  But the Court nowhere 
suggested that a Fifth Amendment violation happens even before a 
government denies the required co mpensation.  (You will scan the 
majority’s description of First English  in vain for a quote to that ef-
fect—because no such quote exists.  See ante, at 9–11.) To the contrary, 
the Court went out of its way to recognize the Williamson County 
principle that “no constitutional violation occurs until just compensa -
tion has been denied.”  482 U. S., at 320, n. 10 (internal quotation 
marks omitted).

the majority, this Court’s cases establish that such an
action “ is a claim for a violation of the Fifth Amend-
ment”—that is, for a constitutional offense that has al-
ready happened because of the absence of advance pay-
ment. Ante, at 19, n. 7 (emphasis in original); see ante , 
at 13. But again, the precedents say the opposite.  The 
Tucker Act is the Federal Go vernment’s equivalent of a 
State’s inverse condemnation procedure, by which a prop-
erty owner can obtain just compensation. The former, no 
less than the latter, forestalls any constitutional violation 
by ensuring that an owner gets full and fair payment for a
taking.  The Court, for example, stated in United States v. 
Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc. , 474 U. S. 121, 128 (1985), 
that “so long as [post-taking Tucker Act] compensation is 
available for those whose property is in fact taken, the
governmental action is not unconstitutional.”  Similarly,
we held in Preseault v. ICC, 494 U. S. 1, 4–5 (1990) that 
when “compensation is available to [property owners] 
under the Tucker Act[,] the requirements of the Fifth 
Amendment are satisfied.” And again, in Ruckelshaus v. 
Monsanto Co., 467 U. S. 986, 1016 (1984) we rejected a
takings claim because the plaintiff could “seek just com-
pensation under the Tucker Act” and “[t]he Fifth Amend-
ment does not require that compensation precede the
taking.”  All those decisions (and there are others) rested 
on the premise, merely reiterated in Williamson County , 
that the “availability of a suit for compensation against 
the sovereign will defeat a contention that the action is 
unconstitutional as a violation of the Fifth Amendment.” 
Larson v. Domestic and Foreign Commerce Corp. , 337 
U. S. 682, 697, n. 18 (1949).

5 Jacobs v. United States, 290 U. S. 13 (1933), the Tucker Act case the

KAGAN, J., dissenting 
To the extent it deals with these cases (mostly, it just
ignores them), the majority says only that they (like Wil-
liamson County ) were “confused” or wrong.  See ante, at 
13, 19, n. 7.  But maybe the majority should take the hint:
When a theory requires declaring precedent after prece-
dent after precedent wrong, that’s a sign the theory itself 
may be wrong.  The majority’s theory is just that.

And not only wrong on prior law. The majority’s over-
ruling of Williamson County will have two damaging 
consequences.  It will inevitably turn even well-meaning
government officials into lawbreakers. And it will subvert 
important principles of judicial federalism. 
To begin with, today’s decision means that government 
regulators will often have no way to avoid violating the 
Constitution. There are a “nearly infinite variety of ways”
for regulations to “affect property interests.” Arkansas 
Game and Fish Comm’n v. United States, 568 U. S. 23, 31 
(2012). And under modern takings law, there is “no magic
formula” to determine “whether a given government inter-
ference with property is a taking.”  Ibid. For that reason, 
a government actor usually cannot know in advance
whether implementing a regulatory program will effect a 
taking, much less of whose property.  Until today, such an
official could do his work without fear of wrongdoing, in
any jurisdiction that had set up a reliable means for prop-
erty owners to obtain compensa tion.  Even if some regula-
tory action turned out to take someone’s property, the 
official would not have violated the Constitution.  But no 
longer. Now, when a government undertakes land-use 
—————— 
Act vindicates arises from—or “rests upon”—th e Fifth Amendment. 
But that is a far cry from saying, as the majority does, that the 
Government has already violated the Fifth Amendment when the 
Tucker Act claim is brought—before  the Government has denied fair 
compensation.

regulation (and what government doesn’t?), the responsi-
ble employees will almost inescapably become constitu-
tional malefactors.  That is not a fair position in which to
place persons carrying out their governmental duties. 
Still more important, the ma jority’s ruling channels to 
federal courts a (potentially massive) set of cases that 
more properly belongs, at least in the first instance, in
state courts—where Williamson County put them. The 
regulation of land use, this Court has stated, is “perhaps 
the quintessential state activity.”  FERC v. Mississippi, 
456 U. S. 742, 768, n. 30 (1982).  And a claim that a land-
use regulation violates the Takings Clause usually turns 
on state-law issues. In that respect, takings claims have
little in common with other constitutional challenges.  The 
question in takings cases is not merely whether a given
state action meets federal constitutional standards. Be -
fore those standards can come into play, a court must
typically decide whether, under state law, the plaintiff has 
a property interest in the thing regulated.  See Phillips v. 
Washington Legal Foundation , 524 U. S. 156, 164 (1998); 
see also Sterk, The Demise of Federal Takings Litigation, 
48 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 251, 288 (2006) (“[I]f background 
state law did not recognize or create property in the first 
instance, then a subsequent state action cannot take 
property”).  Often those quest ions—how does pre-existing 
state law define the property right?; what interests does 
that law grant?; and conversely what interests does it 
deny?—are nuanced and complicated.  And not a one of 
them is familiar to federal courts. 
This case highlights the difficulty.  The ultimate consti-
tutional question here is: Di d Scott Township’s cemetery
ordinance “go[] too far” (in Justice Holmes’s phrase), so as
to effect a taking of Rose Mary Knick’s property? Pennsyl-
vania Coal Co.  v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393, 415 (1922).  But 
to answer that question, it is first necessary to address an
issue about background state law.  In the Township’s view,

KAGAN, J., dissenting 
the ordinance did little more than codify Pennsylvania
common law, which (the Township says) has long required 
property owners to make land containing human remains 
open to the public.  See Brief for Respondents 48; Brief for 
Cemetery Law Scholars as Amici Curiae  6–26. If the 
Township is right on that state-law question, Knick’s
constitutional claim will fail: The ordinance, on that ac-
count, didn’t go far at all. But Knick contends that no 
common law rule of that kind exists in Pennsylvania.  See 
Reply Brief 22.  And if she is right, her takings claim may 
yet have legs. But is she?  Or is the Township? I confess: 
I don’t know.  Nor, I would venture, do my colleagues on 
the federal bench.  But under today’s decision, it will be 
the Federal District Court for the Middle District of Penn-
sylvania that will have to resolve this question of local
cemetery law.
And if the majority thinks this case is an outlier, it’s
dead wrong; indeed, this case will be easier than many. 
Take Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council , 505 U. S. 
1003 (1992). There, this Court held that a South Carolina 
ban on development of beachfront property worked a 
taking of the plaintiff ’s land—unless the State’s nuisance 
law already prohibited such development.  See id., at 
1027–1030. The Court then—quite sensibly—remanded 
the case to the South Carolina Supreme Court to resolve
that question. See id., at 1031–1032.  (And while spotting
the nuisance issue, the Court may have overlooked other 
state-law constraints on development.  In some States, for 
example, the public trust doctrine or public prescriptive
easements limit the development of beachfront land.  See 
Sterk, The Federalist Dimension of Regulatory Takings
Jurisprudence, 114 Yale L. J. 203, 227 (2004).)  Or consider 
Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc.  v. Florida Dept. of 
Environmental Protection , 560 U. S. 702 (2010).  The 
federal constitutional issue there was whether a decision 
of the Florida Supreme Court relating to beachfront prop-

erty constituted a taking.  To resolve that issue, though, 
the Court first had to address whether, under pre-existing
Florida property law, “littoral-property owners had rights
to future accretions and contact with the water superior to
the State’s right to fill in its submerged land.”  Id., at 730. 
The Court bit the bullet and decided that issue itself, as it 
sometimes has to (though thankf ully with the benefit of a
state high court’s reasoning).  But there is no such necessity 
here—and no excuse for making complex state-law 
issues part of the daily diet of federal district courts. 
State courts are—or at any rate, are supposed to be—
the “ultimate expositors of state law.”  Mullaney v. Wilbur, 
421 U. S. 684, 691 (1975).  The corollary is that federal 
courts should refrain whenever possible from deciding 
novel or difficult state-law quest ions.  That stance, as this 
Court has long understood, respects the “rightful inde-
pendence of the state governments,” “avoid[s] needless 
friction with state policies,” and promotes “harmonious
relation[s] between state and federal authority.”  Railroad 
Comm’n of Tex. v. Pullman Co. , 312 U. S. 496, 500–501 
(1941). For that reason, this Court has promoted practices
of certification and abstention to put difficult state-law 
issues in state judges’ hands.  See, e.g., Arizonans for 
Official English  v. Arizona, 520 U. S. 43, 77 (1997) (en-
couraging certification of “novel or unsettled questions of 
state law” to “hel[p] build a cooperative judicial federal -
ism”); Louisiana Power & Light Co. v. City of Thibodaux , 
360 U. S. 25, 28 (1959) (approving federal-court abstention
in an eminent domain proceeding because such cases “turn
on legislation with much local variation interpreted in
local settings”).  We may as well not have bothered.  To-
day’s decision sends a flood of complex state-law issues to 
federal courts. It makes federal courts a principal player
in local and state land-use disputes.  It betrays judicial 
federalism.

KAGAN, J., dissenting 
IV 
Everything said above aside, Williamson County should 
stay on the books because of stare decisis . Adherence to 
precedent is “a foundation stone of the rule of law.”  Mich-
igan v. Bay Mills Indian Community , 572 U. S. 782, 798 
(2014). “[I]t promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and 
consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance 
on judicial decisions, and co ntributes to the actual and 
perceived integrity of the judicial process.”  Payne v. Ten-
nessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991).  Stare decisis, of course, 
is “not an inexorable command.” Id., at 828. But it is not 
enough that five Justices believe a precedent wrong. 
Reversing course demands a “special justification—over 
and above the belief that the precedent was wrongly de-
cided.” Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC , 576 U. S. 
___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 8) (internal quotation marks
omitted). The majority offers no reason that qualifies.
In its only real stab at a sp ecial justification, the major-
ity focuses on what it calls the “San Remo preclusion trap.” 
Ante, at 2.  As the majority notes, this Court held in a 
post-Williamson County decision interpreting the full faith 
and credit statute, 28 U. S. C. §1738, that a state court’s 
resolution of an inverse condemnation proceeding has 
preclusive effect in a later federal suit. See San Remo 
Hotel, L. P. v. City and County of San Francisco , 545 U. S. 
323 (2005); ante, at 1–2, 5–6, 22.  The interaction between 
San Remo and Williamson County means that “many 
takings plaintiffs never have the opportunity to litigate in
a federal forum.” Ante, at 22. According to the majority, 
that unanticipated result makes Williamson County itself 
“unworkable.” Ibid. 
But in highlighting the preclusion concern, the majority
only adds to the case for respecting stare decisis—because 
that issue can always be addressed by Congress.  When 
“correction can be had by legislation,” Justice Brandeis 
once stated, the Court should let stand even “error[s on]

matter[s] of serious concern.” Square D Co.  v. Niagara 
Frontier Tariff Bureau, Inc. , 476 U. S. 409, 424 (1986) 
(quoting Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co. , 285 U. S. 393, 
406 (1932) (dissenting)).  Or otherwise said, stare decisis 
then “carries enhanced force.”  Kimble, 576 U. S., at ___ 
(slip op., at 8); see South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., 585 U. S. 
___, ___ (2018) (R OBERTS, C. J., dissenting) (slip op., at 2) 
(The stare decisis “bar is even higher” when Congress “can,
if it wishes, override this Court’s decisions with contrary
legislation”). Here, Congress can reverse the San Remo 
preclusion rule any time it wants, and thus give property 
owners an opportunity— after a state-court proceeding—to
litigate in federal court.  The San Remo decision, as noted 
above, interpreted the federal full faith and credit statute;
Congress need only add a provision to that law to flip the
Court’s result.  In fact, Co ngress has already considered
proposals responding to San Remo —though so far to no
avail. See Brief for Congressman Steve King et al. as 
Amici Curiae 7. Following this Court’s normal rules of 
practice means leaving the San Remo “ball[ in] Congress’s 
court,” so that branch can deci de whether to pick it up. 
Kimble, 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8).

And the majority has no other special justification.  It 
says Williamson County did not create “reliance interests.” 
Ante, at 23.  But even if so, those interests are a plus-
factor in the doctrine; when they exist, stare decisis  be-
comes “superpowered.” Kimble, 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., 
at 10); Payne, 501 U. S., at 828 ( Stare decisis concerns are 
“at their acme” when “reliance interests are involved”).
The absence of reliance is not itself a reason for overruling 
—————— 
6 Confronted with that point, the majority shifts ground.  It notes that 
even if Congress eliminated the San Remo rule, takings plaintiffs 
would still have to comply with Williamson County ’s “unjustified” 
demand that they bring suit in state court first.  See ante, at 22. But 
that argument does not even purport to  state a special justification.  It 
merely reiterates the majority’s view on the merits.

a decision.  Next, the majority says that the “justification 
for [Williamson County’s] state-litigation requirement” has
“evolve[d].” Ante, at 22.  But to start with, it has not.  The 
original rationale—in the majority’s words, that the re -
quirement “is an element of a takings claim,” ante, at 22— 
has held strong for 35 years (including in the cases the 
majority cites), and is the same one I rely on today.  See, 
e.g., Horne, 569 U. S., at 525–526 (quoting Williamson 
County’s rationale); Suitum v. Tahoe Regional Planning 
Agency, 520 U. S. 725, 734 (1997) (same); supra, at 2–3. 
And anyway, “evolution” in the way a decision is described
has never been a ground for abandoning stare decisis . 
Here, the majority’s only citation is to last Term’s decision 
overruling a 40-year-old precedent.  See ante, at 22 (citing 
Janus v. State, County, and Municipal Employees, 585 
U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 23)).  If that is the way
the majority means to proceed—relying on one subversion
of stare decisis to support another—we may as well not 
have principles about precedents at all. 
What is left is simply the majority’s view that William-
son County was wrong. The majority repurposes all its 
merits arguments—all its claims that Williamson County
was “ill founded”—to justify its overruling. Ante, at 20–21. 
But the entire idea of stare decisis is that judges do not get
to reverse a decision just because they never liked it in the 
first instance. Once again, they need a reason other than 
the idea “that the precedent was wrongly decided.”  Halli-
burton Co. v. Erica P. John Fund, Inc. , 573 U. S. 258, 266 
(2014); see supra, at 16.  For it is hard to overstate the 
value, in a country like ours, of stability in the law.
Just last month, when the Court overturned another 
longstanding precedent, J
USTICE BREYER penned a dis-
sent. See Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal.  v. Hyatt, 587 U. S.

course “only because five Members of a later Court” decide 
that an earlier ruling was incorrect. Id., at ___ (slip op., at

Well, that didn’t take long.  Now one may wonder yet 
again.
